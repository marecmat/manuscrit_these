  abstract = {A generalized dispersion equation is derived featuring coupled mode theory, parity-time symmetry, and leaky wave antennas of arbitrary periodic modulation. It can be specialized to each of these cases individually or can describe a structure containing all three electromagnetic phenomena simultaneously in a single antenna. This very general dispersion equation is derived using both mode matching and the transverse resonance method, the latter lacking the ability to provide the field descriptions and wave impedances at the cost of computational simplicity. Using the dispersion equation, a sinusoidally modulated reactive sheet (SMRS) supported by an active impedance sheet backed dielectric spacer is designed. The active impedance sheet is designed to compensate the SMRS radiative leakage loss when coupled in close proximity. Due to the coupling, each spatial harmonic generated by the SMRS modulation is characterized by a purely real propagation constant and hence leaky wave radiation is generated from surface waves which do not decay. Due to the non-decaying nature of the surface waves, an input to output surface wave port-to-port {\textbar}{$\mathbit{S}\mathbf{2}\mathbf{1}\vert$} would be unity despite an open far field channel being generated. The non-decaying leaky surface wave antenna is compared to the traditional PEC backed SMRS. The non-decaying leaky surface waves give rise to perfect aperture efficiency and the associated radiation pattern making it far superior to the traditional PEC backed SMRS case. Full-wave simulations corroborate the results. These types of antennas can make sensors probed from the far field where changes in {$\mathbit{S}\mathbf{2}\mathbf{1}$} amplitude directly correlate to local changes in the waveguiding environment.},

  abstract = {Practical vibroacoustic systems involve passive acoustic treatments consisting of highly dissipative media such as poroelastic materials. The numerical modeling of such systems at low to mid frequencies typically relies on substructuring methodologies based on finite element models. Namely, the master subsystems (i.e., structural and acoustic domains) are described by a finite set of uncoupled modes, whereas condensation procedures are typically preferred for the acoustic treatments. However, although accurate, such methodology is computationally expensive when real life applications are considered. A potential reduction of the computational burden could be obtained by approximating the effect of the acoustic treatment on the master subsystems without introducing physical degrees of freedom. To do that, the treatment has to be assumed homogeneous, flat, and of infinite lateral extent. Under these hypotheses, simple analytical tools like the transfer matrix method can be employed. In this paper, a hybrid finite element--transfer matrix methodology is proposed. The impact of the limiting assumptions inherent within the analytical framework are assessed for the case of plate-cavity systems involving flat and homogeneous acoustic treatments. The results prove that the hybrid model can capture the qualitative behavior of the vibroacoustic system while reducing the computational effort.},

The localization of this pole obtained for a thin layer from this property is compared to measurements performed with a recent transfer function method based on pressure measurements at different source-receiver distances. In this paper, we evaluate cos{$\mkern1mu\theta$}p from pressure measurements on an axis perpendicular to the surface of the layer at small source-receiver offsets, thus this method can be used with small sample sizes.},

It is shown that the predictions by the both methods agree closely. The reflection coefficient and Brewster angle of total refraction for the corrugated semi-infinite medium predicted with these methods are compared against that predicted by the Biot/Tolstoy/Howe/Twersky and extended Twersky models.

It is shown that the Schl{\"o}milch series involving Hankel functions or Neumann functions can be expressed as an absolutely converging series of elementary functions and a finite sum of Lerch transcendent functions, while the Schl{\"o}milch series of Bessel functions can be transformed into a finite sum of elementary functions. The closed-form expressions for the Coates's integrals of integer order have also been found. The derived equations have been verified numerically and their accuracy and efficiency has been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method for modeling wave propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves. The proposed SAFE formulation is applied to several examples, including anisotropic viscoelastic layered plates, composite-to-composite adhesive joints and railroad tracks.},

  abstract = {Computational modeling remains key to the acoustic design of various applications, but it is constrained by the cost of solving large Helmholtz problems at high frequencies. This paper presents an efficient implementation of the high-order finite element method (FEM) for tackling large-scale engineering problems arising in acoustics. A key feature of the proposed method is the ability to select automatically the order of interpolation in each element so as to obtain a target accuracy while minimizing the cost. This is achieved using a simple local a priori error indicator. For simulations involving several frequencies, the use of hierarchical shape functions leads to an efficient strategy to accelerate the assembly of the finite element model. The intrinsic performance of the high-order FEM for 3D Helmholtz problem is assessed, and an error indicator is devised to select the polynomial order in each element. A realistic 3D application is presented in detail to demonstrate the reduction in computational costs and the robustness of the a priori error indicator. For this test case, the proposed method accelerates the simulation by an order of magnitude and requires less than a quarter of the memory needed by the standard FEM. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the velocity of the propagation of energy in guided waves in plates. The motivation of the work comes from the practical observation that the conventional approach to predicting the velocities of pulses or wave packets, that is, the simple group velocity calculation, breaks down when the guided waves are attenuative. The conventional approach is therefore not valid for guided waves in absorbing materials or for leaky waves. The paper presents a theoretical derivation of an expression to predict the energy velocity of guided waves in an isotropic plate, based on the integration of the Poynting energy vectors. When applied to modes with no attenuation, it is shown analytically from this expression that the energy velocity is always identical to the group velocity. On the other hand, when applied to attenuative modes, numerical integration of the expression to yield the true energy velocity shows that this can differ quite significantly from the group velocity. Experimental validation of the expression is achieved by measuring the velocity of wave packets in an absorbing plate, under such conditions when the energy velocity differs substantially from the group velocity. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions and the measurements. The paper also shows the Poynting vectors in the various model studies, and some interesting phenomena relating to their directions.},

The best microgeometry continuous gradient providing the optimal acoustic reflection and/or transmission is designed via a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm. The acoustic performances of the so-designed continuous graded material are discussed with respect to the optimized homogeneous, i.e., nongraded and monotonically graded material. The numerical results show a shifting of the perfect absorption peak to lower frequencies or a widening of the perfect absorption frequency range for graded materials when compared to uniform ones. The results are validated experimentally on 3D-printed samples, therefore, confirming the relevance of such a gradient along with the efficiency of the control of the entire design process.},

  abstract = {The development of seismic metamaterials has attracted much research interest in the past decade. Efforts have been made by using experimental and theoretical approaches to isolate buildings and structures susceptible to elastic surface wave damage. However, most seismic metamaterials were designed without considering the viscoelastic effect that widely exists in nature. In this work, we investigate the propagation and attenuation of the Rayleigh and pseudo surface waves (PSWs) in two types of viscoelastic seismic metamaterials, namely, pillared and inclusion-embedded metamaterials, by analyzing the complex band structures and transmission spectra. The complex band structure developed in this work reveals for the first time the existence of PSWs and their propagation properties in inclusion-embedded metamaterials at the surface. These PSW modes are hidden in the traditional {$\omega$}(k) technique, therefore showing the usefulness of the complex band structure approach. Introducing viscosity to the substrate of both types of seismic metamaterials will enhance the attenuation of both the Rayleigh wave and PSW. For inclusion-embedded metamaterials, the viscoelastic effect in the soft coating layer can have a specific influence only on the PSW. PSWs show advantages to minimize the relative attenuating effect in general. The results in this work will open up great possibilities for designing and optimizing seismic metamaterials in practice.},

Modal wavenumbers are obtained by computing the complex zeroes of the homogeneous equation characterizing the field in the one dimensional periodic array. The required periodic Green's function is analytically continued into the complex wavenumber space by using the Ewald method. Furthermore, a parametric analysis of the mode wavenumbers is performed with respect to the geometrical parameters of the array.},

  abstract = {With the rapid urbanization and fast growth of transportation, noise pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems in front of the people worldwide, it usually causes various disorders and greatly affects the work efficiency and living standards of human beings. Reducing noise by using sound absorption materials is an important approach to lessen the harm of noise pollution. As the most abundantly used materials, porous materials combine the properties of lightweight, wide absorption frequency range and highly sound absorption ability, and they hold great potential in the field of sound absorption. In this review, the recent progress in the design and fabrication of porous sound absorption materials is summarized and highlighted. This review covers the introduction of the sound absorption mechanism and evolution of prediction models for porous sound absorption materials, and the research and development of the design concepts and fabrication of sound absorption foams and fibrous sound absorption materials. The review concludes with some perspectives and outlook for the porous sound absorption materials.},

A semi-analytical model is described and used for predicting the dispersion curves (phase velocity, energy velocity, and complex wave-number) and the through-thickness distribution fields (displacement, stress, and energy flow). Guided modes propagating along a test-sandwich plate are shown to be quite different than classical Lamb modes, because this structure does not have the mirror symmetry, contrary to most of composite material plates. Moreover, the viscoelastic material properties imply complex roots of the dispersion equation to be found that lead to connections between some of the dispersion curves, meaning that some of the modes get coupled together. Gradual variation from zero to nominal values of the imaginary parts of the viscoelastic moduli shows that the mode coupling depends on the level of material viscoelasticity, except for one particular case where this phenomenon exists whether the medium is viscoelastic or not. The model is used to quantify the sensitivity of both the dispersion curves and the through-thickness mode shapes to the level of material viscoelasticity, and to physically explain the mode-coupling phenomenon. Finite element software is also used to confirm results obtained for the purely elastic structure. Finally, experiments are made using ultrasonic, air-coupled transducers for generating and detecting guided modes in the test-sandwich structure. The mode-coupling phenomenon is then confirmed, and the potential of the air-coupled system for developing single-sided, contactless, NDT applications of such structures is discussed.},

This paper presents a further development, addressing the problem of attenuating waves in which the attenuation is caused by leakage from the waveguide into a surrounding material. This has broad relevance to many practical problems in which a waveguide is immersed in a fluid or embedded in a solid. The paper presents the principles of a procedure and then validates and illustrates its use on some examples. The procedure makes use of absorbing regions of material at the exterior bounds of the discretized domain.},

Together with the rise of additive manufacturing techniques, new possibilities are emerging from engineered porous micro-structures. In this work, we present a theoretical and numerical study of graded and anisotropic porous materials, for optimal broadband and angular absorption. Through a parametric study, the effective acoustic and geometric parameters of homogenized anisotropic unit cells constitute a database in which the optimal anisotropic and graded material will be searched for. We develop an optimization technique based on the simplex method that is relying on this database. The concepts of average absorption and diffuse field absorption coefficients are introduced and used to maximize angular acoustic absorption. Numerical results present the optimized absorption of the designed anisotropic and graded porous materials for different acoustic targets. The designed materials have anisotropic and graded effective properties, which enhance its sound absorption capabilities. While the anisotropy largely enhances the diffuse field absorbing when optimized at a single frequency, graded properties appear to be crucial for optimal broadband diffuse field absorption.},

  abstract = {Porous materials and metamaterials play a key role in sound absorbing and insulation solutions in acoustics. With the growing interest in additive manufacturing techniques, recent work has focused on the printing of porous and resonant structures for acoustic purposes. Usual metaporous surfaces/interfaces are generally built by periodically inserting resonant elements in an existing porous layer. This complex manufacturing process can be significantly simplified by using additive manufacturing techniques, which also eases the design and optimization of the metaporous surface. In this work, the acoustic properties of the metaporous surface are controlled by simple geometric parameters defining both the anisotropic porous layer and the shapes of the resonators. Hence, we focus on optimizing split-ring resonators embedded in a micro-treillis porous layer, which are built in a single part using additive manufacturing techniques. A finite-element method together with Bloch wave decomposition provides a numerical model used to predict the reflection and absorption coefficients under normal incidence. The geometric parameters of the anisotropic metaporous surface are then optimized by non-linear minimization techniques to maximize acoustic absorption. An optimal metaporous surface is 3D printed by fused-deposition modeling, and its acoustic properties are measured in an impedance tube. The measurements are in good agreement with the predicted optimal broadband absorption coefficient. This work demonstrates the benefits of additive manufacturing for designing metaporous acoustic surfaces.},

In-depth analysis has been devoted to the seemingly simplest array system: a one-dimensionally periodic lattice of two-dimensional scatterers embedded in a dispersionless medium governed by the Helmholtz equation. We investigate such a system and experimentally confirm the existence of a new class of generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves that have been recently theorised to exist in classical wave regimes, without the need for resonant scatterers. Airborne acoustics serves as such a regime and we experimentally observe the first generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves above the first cut-off, i.e., in the radiative regime. We consider radiative acoustic lattice resonances along a diffraction grating and connect them to generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves by considering both short and long arrays of non-resonant 2D cylindrical Neumann scatterers embedded in air. On short arrays, we observe finite lattice resonances under continuous wave excitation, and on long arrays, we observe propagating Rayleigh--Bloch waves under pulsed excitation. We interpret their existence by considering multiple wave scattering theory and, in doing so, unify differing nomenclatures used to describe waves on infinite periodic and finite arrays and the interpretation of their dispersive properties.},

  abstract = {This paper exposes a procedure to couple multiport transfer matrices to finite elements for analyzing the acoustics of automotive hollow body networks with a minimum of memory requirements and computational time. Generally, hollow body networks are made up from a series of elongated fluid partitions similar to ducts or waveguides. These fluid partitions generally contain complex elements: junctions, noise control elements, and cavities. The location and type of these elements in the network, mainly the noise control elements (e.g., sealing parts), may impact the noise inside a car. In the proposed hybrid method, the elongated fluid partitions are modeled with fluid finite elements. All complexities are modeled with two-port or multiport transfer matrices. The coupling of these matrices to finite elements is naturally done at the weak integral formulation stage of the acoustical problem. The coupling does not add any degrees of freedom to, nor modify, the original finite element matrix system. Consequently, changing locations and types of noise control elements in the hollow body network is fast and does not require rebuilding the finite element system. This enables optimizing the acoustics of a complex network on a desktop computer. The hybrid method is compared to experimental results on a tee-shaped hollow body networks. Good correlations are obtained.},

Contrary to the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), this method does not become unstable for high frequencies or large layer thicknesses. This method is shown to be as general as the TMM and mathematically equivalent. Its principle is to consider a so called Information Vector which contains all the information necessary to deduce the State Vector through a Translation Matrix. The Information Vector is of reduced length compared to that of the State Vector and can be propagated in any layer without involving exponentially growing terms. In addition, this method enables the coupling between any type of physical media as far as proper boundary relations can be written. Moreover, the method does not lead to an enlargement of the systems' size in the case of interfaces between media of different physical type. Finally, this method can be easily implemented in numerical codes. The method is validated on three cases classically encountered in acoustic problems. However, it is general enough to model any type of multilayered problems in any field of applied physics.},

  abstract = {Porous materials are widely used for improving sound absorption and sound transmission loss of vibrating structures. However, their efficiency is limited to medium and high frequencies of sound. A solution for improving their low frequency behavior while keeping an acceptable thickness is to embed resonant structures such as Helmholtz resonators (HRs). This work investigates the absorption and transmission acoustic performances of a cellular porous material with a two-dimensional periodic arrangement of HR inclusions. A low frequency model of a resonant periodic unit cell based on the parallel transfer matrix method is presented. The model is validated by comparison with impedance tube measurements and simulations based on both the finite element method and a homogenization based model. At the HR resonance frequency (i) the transmission loss is greatly improved and (ii) the sound absorption of the foam can be either decreased or improved depending on the HR tuning frequency and on the thickness and properties of the host foam. Finally, the diffuse field sound absorption and diffuse field sound transmission loss performance of a 2.6 m2 resonant cellular material are measured. It is shown that the improvements observed at the Helmholtz resonant frequency on a single cell are confirmed at a larger scale.},

The method can be applied to any kind of material with layers, i.e., fluid, anisotropic and viscoelastic. The two external interfaces of the plate can be described as either vacuum/vacuum, fluid/vacuum, or fluid/fluid with a single fluid or fluid/fluid with two different fluids. The method is based on the discretization of the plate by using a finite differences scheme in its vertical direction. One global state vector is associated with inner discretized positions of each layer, and two local state vectors characterize the physical state at its bounds. Interfacial state vectors are introduced in certain situations at external and internal plate interfaces. With these state vectors and after pertinent algebraic manipulations, an eigenvalue system is built. Its solutions are searched by fixing the slowness, wavevector or frequency of guided waves. These three parameterizations correspond to three different physical models. For each case, discussions of dispersion curves and attenuation curves are given for guided modes in a plate loaded by fluids at one or two sides. This numerical tool is shown to provide convenience and accuracy.},

This provides a model with which computations of the leaky Lamb modes are seen to be compatible. The imaginary components of the propagating modes form a ``resonance pattern'' which contains all the information on the plate's transmittivity. The level of this pattern increases with the ratio of fluid to plate density. When the latter ratio is large enough to cause the resonance pattern to overlap the peaks of the well-known imaginary semiloops, there is interaction leading to transition from the leaky Lamb mode behavior to that of a plate clamped on its surfaces with slip boundary conditions. There is general agreement with the conclusions of S. I. Rokhlin et\hphantom{,}al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 85, 1074--1080 (1989)] and the present work broadens the parameter range over which those conclusions have been shown to hold.},

Commonly used polymers for underwater sound comprise, in general, interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN), polymer foams, and gradient polymers. To further improve underwater sound absorption performance, different types of inclusions that are introduced into the polymer matrix to transform the polymers as underwater sound absorption materials via air voids, solid inclusions, nanofillers, and phononic crystals are discussed. Challenges for further development of better polymer-based acoustic materials to meet requirements of current and future underwater applications are also presented.},

Dispersion equations are obtained from the application of an integral transform in the frequency domain. Such relations are of the Kramers-KrSnig type, relating the dispersive part of the index of refraction of the medium to the absorptive part by means of an integral over the entire frequency range. They are a consequenceof the principle of causality and follow without recourse to a specific wave equation. In particular, our results are consistent with and presume lineartry for the wave motion. Three forms of the dispersion equation are exhibited. In all cases,the absorption coefficienthas a linear dependenceupon frequency for frequenciesabove a certain characteristic value--chosen low enough to be outside the range of measurement. However, it is necessaryin all casesto introduce a low-frequency,nonzero cutoff for the absorption,which can in principlebe taken arbitrarily small. Group and phasevelocitiesare determined as functions of the medium Q and a characteristic velocity, which for small absorption can be related to the measured signal velocity. Seismic phenomena occur in materials where the absorption is small, Q \_{$\bullet$} 30, so that the correspondingdispersionpresumably will be difficult to measure in the earth. For appropriate laboratory materials the effect can be significant.},

  abstract = {Several numerical methods using non-polynomial interpolation have been proposed for wave propagation problems at high frequencies. The common feature of these methods is that in each element, the solution is approximated by a set of local solutions. They can provide very accurate solutions with a much smaller number of degrees of freedom compared to polynomial interpolation. There are however significant differences in the way the matching conditions enforcing the continuity of the solution between elements can be formulated. The similarities and discrepancies between several non-polynomial numerical methods are discussed in the context of the Helmholtz equation. The present comparison is concerned with the ultraweak variational formulation (UWVF), the least-squares method (LSM) and the discontinuous Galerkin method with numerical flux (DGM). An analysis in terms of Trefftz methods provides an interesting insight into the properties of these methods. Second, the UWVF and the LSM are reformulated in a similar fashion to that of the DGM. This offers a unified framework to understand the properties of several non-polynomial methods. Numerical results are also presented to put in perspective the relative accuracy of the methods.

  abstract = {Poro-elastic materials are commonly used for passive control of noise and vibration and are key to reducing noise emissions in many engineering applications, including the aerospace, automotive and energy industries. More efficient computational models are required to further optimise the use of such materials. In this paper, we present a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) with plane waves for poro-elastic materials using the Biot theory solved in the frequency domain. This approach offers significant gains in computational efficiency and is simple to implement (costly numerical quadratures of highly oscillatory integrals are not needed). It is shown that the Biot equations can be easily cast as a set of conservation equations suitable for the formulation of the wave-based DGM. A key contribution is a general formulation of boundary conditions as well as coupling conditions between different propagation media. This is particularly important when modelling porous materials as they are generally coupled with other media, such as the surround fluid or an elastic structure. The validation of the method is described first for a simple wave propagating through a porous material, and then for the scattering of an acoustic wave by a porous cylinder. The accuracy, conditioning and computational cost of the method are assessed, and comparison with the standard finite element method is included. It is found that the benefits of the wave-based DGM are fully realised for the Biot equations and that the numerical model is able to accurately capture both the oscillations and the rapid attenuation of the waves in the porous material.

Using the Finite Element Method (FEM) only would result in a drastic increase of the degrees of freedom due to the fine mesh required to account for the very thin coatings. Here, the approach relies on: the Bloch wave expansion of the fields in air; the modal Transfer Matrix Method to account for the coatings; and the coupling with the FEM model of the poroelastic matrix and the resonant inclusions. The model is developed for reflection and transmission problems and it can account for coatings with multiple layers. The procedure induces the addition of the Bloch coefficients in the FEM's linear system at a negligible additional computational cost. It is applied to the meta poroelastic laminates with poroelastic inclusions and rubber shell inclusions. The results are compared with those from the Multiple Scattering Theory and an excellent agreement between the methods is found. The approach offers a numerically-efficient way to account for coatings applied to meta poroelastic layers, and finds applications in industrial prototypes where coatings are widely used.},

The accuracy of finite element calculation (FEA) is verified by the theoretical model established by transfer matrix (TM) method at radial coordinates. Relative to pure viscoelastic rubber and traditional cavity acoustic absorption structure, the proposed structure could show excellent broadband acoustic absorption performance below 10 kHz. The geometrical size, shape, and position of filler also affect the direction of shear wave propagation after the transformation, which is critical reason behind the broadband underwater acoustic absorption. Different geometries and material parameters also could adjust the acoustic absorption to a great extent.

  abstract = {Leaky waves are an important class of waves, particularly for guiding waves along structures embedded within another medium; a mismatch in wavespeeds often leads to leakage of energy from the waveguide, or interface, into the medium, which consequently attenuates the guided wave. The accurate and efficient identification of theoretical solutions for leaky waves is a key requirement for the choices of modes and frequencies required for non-destructive evaluation inspection techniques. We choose a typical situation to study: an elastic waveguide with a fluid on either side. Historically, leaky waves are identified via root-finding methods that have issues with conditioning, or numerical methods that struggle with the exponential growth of solutions at infinity. By building upon a spectral collocation method, we show how it can be adjusted to find exponentially growing solutions, i.e., leaky waves, leading to an accurate, fast, and efficient identification of their dispersion properties. The key concept required is a mapping, in the fluid region, that allows for exponential growth of the physical solution at infinity, whilst the mapped numerical setting decays. We illustrate this by studying leaky Lamb waves in an elastic waveguide immersed between two different fluids and verify this using the commercially available software DISPERSE.},

  abstract = {In non-destructive evaluation guided wave inspections, the elastic structure to be inspected is often embedded within other elastic media and the ensuing leaky waves are complex and non-trivial to characterise; we consider the canonical example of an elastic waveguide surrounded by other elastic materials that demonstrates the fundamental issues with characterising the leaky waves in such systems. Due to the complex wavenumber solutions required to represent them, leaky waves pose significant challenges to existing numerical methods, while methods that spatially discretise the field to retrieve them suffer from the exponential growth of their amplitude far into the surrounding media. We present a spectral collocation method yielding an accurate and efficient identification of these modes, leaking into elastic half-spaces. We discretise the elastic domains and, depending on the exterior bulk wavespeeds, select appropriate mappings of the discretised domain to complex paths, in which the numerical solution decays and the physics of the problem are preserved. By iterating through all possible radiation cases, the full set of dispersion and attenuation curves are successfully retrieved and validated, where possible, against the commercially available software DISPERSE. As an independent validation, dispersion curves are obtained from finite element simulations of time-dependent waves using Fourier analysis.},

The formulation is based on the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method. The through-thickness direction of the plate is discretized in the finite element sense, while the direction of propagation is described analytically. This leads to a standard eigenvalue problem for the calculation of wave numbers. The proposed method is not limited to homogeneous plates. Multilayered composites as well as structures with continuously varying material parameters in the direction of thickness can be modeled without essential changes in the formulation. Higher-order elements have been employed for the finite element discretization, leading to excellent convergence for complex structures. It is shown by numerical examples that this method provides highly accurate results with a small number of nodes while avoiding numerical problems and instabilities.},

This problem is of relevance, e.g., for the simulation of guided ultrasound in embedded plate structures or seismic waves in soil layers over an elastic half-space. We employ a semi-analytical formulation to describe the layers, thus discretizing the thickness direction by means of finite elements. For a free layer, this technique leads to a well-known quadratic eigenvalue problem for the mode shapes and corresponding horizontal wavenumbers. Rigorously incorporating the coupling conditions to account for the adjacent half-spaces gives rise to additional terms that are nonlinear in the wavenumber. We show that the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem can be cast in the form of a multiparameter eigenvalue problem whose solutions represent the wave numbers in the plate and in the half-spaces. The multiparameter eigenvalue problem is solved numerically using recently developed algorithms.},

The inclusions and porous skeleton are assumed motionless. Such a structure behaves like a multi-component diffraction grating. Numerical results show that this structure presents a quasi-total (close to unity) absorption peak below the quarter-wavelength resonance of the porous sheet in absence of inclusions. This result is explained by the excitation of a complex trapped mode. When more than one inclusion per spatial period is considered, additional quasi-total absorption peaks are observed. The numerical results, as calculated with the help of the mode-matching method described in this paper, agree with those calculated using a finite element method.},

We show experimentally the validity of the models using mixtures of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and TiO2 particles. The optimized composite material has the same longitudinal acoustic impedance as water and therefore the acoustic reflection coefficient is essentially zero over a wide range of frequencies (0.5--6 MHz). PDMS-based materials can be cured in a mold to achieve desired sample shape, which makes them very easy to handle and to use. Various applications can be envisioned, such the use of impedance-matched PDMS in the design and fabrication of acoustically transparent cells for samples, perfectly matched layers for ultrasonic experiments, or superabsorbing metamaterials for water-borne acoustic waves.},

The experimental relaxation function, well described by the Mittag--Leffler function, allows for straightforward prediction of the frequency-dependence of complex modulus of polyurethane foams. To show the feasibility of this approach, complex shear moduli of the same foams were measured in the frequency range between 0.1 and 16 Hz and at different temperatures between -20 {$^\circ$}C and 20 {$^\circ$}C. A curve was reconstructed on the reduced frequency range (0.1 Hz--1 MHz) using the time--temperature superposition principle. Very good agreement was obtained between experimental complex moduli values and the fractional Zener model predictions. The proposed time domain method may constitute an improved alternative to resonant and non-resonant techniques often used for dynamic characterization of polymers for the determination of viscoelastic moduli on a broad frequency range.},

The computed group velocity curves are compared with published values of the group velocities at various frequencies of Rayleigh waves over continental paths. The scatter of the observed values is larger than the difference between the three computed curves.

This study describes leaky Lamb wave calculation with the SAFE. We formulated a new solution using a feature that a single Lamb wave mode generates a harmonic plane wave in leaky media. Dispersion curves obtained with the SAFE agreed well with the previous theoretical studies, which represents that the SAFE calculation was conducted with sufficient accuracy.

  abstract = {The interpenetrating network structure provides an interesting avenue to novel materials. Locally resonant phononic crystal (LRPC) exhibits excellent sound attenuation performance based on the periodical arrangement of sound wave scatters. Combining the LRPC concept and interpenetrating network glassy structure, this paper has developed a new material which can achieve a wide band underwater strong acoustic absorption. Underwater absorption coefficients of different samples were measured by the pulse tube. Measurement results show that the new material possesses excellent underwater acoustic effects in a wide frequency range. Moreover, in order to investigate impacts of locally resonant units, some defects are introduced into the sample. The experimental result and the theoretical calculation both show that locally resonant units being connected to a network structure play an important role in achieving a wide band strong acoustic absorption.},

  abstract = {Multilayered plate and shell structures play an important role in many engineering settings where, for instance, coated pipes are commonplace such as in the petrochemical, aerospace, and power generation industries. There are numerous demands, and indeed requirements, on nondestructive evaluation (NDE) to detect defects or to measure material properties using guided waves; to choose the most suitable inspection approach, it is essential to know the properties of the guided wave solutions for any given multilayered system and this requires dispersion curves computed reliably, robustly, and accurately. Here, the circumstances are elucidated, and possible layer combinations, under which guided wave solutions, in multilayered systems composed of generally anisotropic layers in flat and cylindrical geometries, have specific properties of coupling and parity; the partial wave decomposition of the wave field is utilised to unravel the behaviour. A classification into five families is introduced and the authors claim that this is the fundamental way to approach generally anisotropic waveguides. This coupling and parity provides information to be used in the design of more efficient and robust dispersion curve tracing algorithms. A critical benefit is that the analysis enables the separation of solutions into categories for which dispersion curves do not cross; this allows the curves to be calculated simply and without ambiguity.},

  abstract = {The most common way of solving the quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) ( 2 M + D + K )x = 0 is to convert it into a linear problem ( X + Y )z = 0 of twice the dimension and solve the linear problem by the QZ algorithm or a Krylov method. In doing so, it is important to understand the influence of the linearization process on the accuracy and stability of the computed solution. We discuss these issues for three particular linearizations: the standard companion linearization and two linearizations that preserve symmetry in the problem. For illustration we employ a model QEP describing the motion of a beam simply supported at both ends and damped at the midpoint. We show that the above linearizations lead to poor numerical results for the beam problem, but that a two-parameter scaling proposed by Fan, Lin and Van Dooren cures the instabilities. We also show that half of the eigenvalues of the beam QEP are pure imaginary and are eigenvalues of the undamped problem. Our analysis makes use of recently developed theory explaining the sensitivity and stability of linearizations, the main conclusions of which are summarized. As well as arguing that scaling should routinely be used, we give guidance on how to choose a linearization and illustrate the practical value of condition numbers and backward errors.

  abstract = {Natural and engineered media usually involve combinations of solid, fluid and porous layers, and accurate and stable modelling of wave propagation in such complex multilayered media is fundamental to evaluating their properties with wave-based methods. Here we present a general stiffness matrix method for modelling waves in arbitrary multilayers. The method first formulates stiffness matrices for individual layers based on the governing wave equations for fluids and solids, and the Biot theory for porous materials. Then it utilises the boundary conditions considered at layer interfaces to assemble the layer matrices into a global system of equations, to obtain solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients at any incidence. Its advantage over existing methods is manifested by its unconditional computational stability, and its validity is proved by experimental validations on single solid sheets, porous layers, and porous-solid-porous battery electrodes. This establishes a powerful theoretical platform that allows us to develop advanced wave-based methods to quantitatively characterise properties of the layers, especially for layers of porous materials.},

  abstract = {Guided waves are used for the non-destructive evaluation in automotive and aerospace industries. There is a trend leaning away from isotropic materials to the manufacturing based on composites. However, the elastic wave dynamics in such materials is considerably more complicated. Much effort has been committed to the calculation of guided waves' dispersion curves in composites. Lots of methods and tools are available, but it becomes difficult when there are more than one hundred layers. In this paper the calculation of dispersion diagrams and mode shapes using the stiffness matrix method is demonstrated. Boundary conditions are implemented into the stiffness matrix method that allow for the separate tracing of the various mode families. Shear horizontal modes are modeled with the transfer matrix method without facing any numerical instability. It is elucidated just how the occurrence of the mode families depends on the system's symmetry and wave propagation direction. As a result, the robustness and reliability of guided wave modeling by using the stiffness method is improved, and more information about the modes is yielded. This is demonstrated on exemplary layups of the fiber reinforced polymer T800/913, with up to 400 layers. Referencing is made against results from DISPERSE{\textregistered} (Imperial College London, London, UK) for selected cases.},

  abstract = {Guided ultrasonic waves are used for the inspection of multilayered composite aerospace structures. Calculating the corresponding dispersion diagrams is challenging for thick-walled composites with more than 100 layers, such as in modern rocket booster pressure vessels. The Dispersion Calculator (DC) is an open source software for calculating such dispersion diagrams and mode shapes of guided waves. Attenuation caused by viscoelasticity and fluid-loading makes the dispersion curve tracing much more difficult than in the nonattenuated case because the modal solutions are sought in the complex wavenumber plane. The tracing problem is mastered by a reliable algorithm. Whereas leaky Lamb and Scholte waves in coupled and decoupled cases are modeled using the stiffness matrix method, shear horizontal (SH) waves are traced using the transfer matrix method without facing the numerical instability. Through implementation of mode family specific dispersion equations in both matrix techniques for nonattenuated and attenuated cases, symmetric, antisymmetric, and nonsymmetric leaky Lamb, Scholte, and SH waves can be traced separately with better efficiency and robustness. The capabilities of DC are demonstrated by calculating dispersion diagrams and mode shapes for a viscoelastic composite with 400 layers immersed in water. Results are compared against DISPERSE (Imperial College London, London, UK) for selected cases.},

We theoretically analyze different configurations of increasing complexity: a single layer of high-porous material, a layer of high-porous material with an air gap (air plenum), and an optimized multilayer structure. First, we show that to obtain normal incidence perfect sound absorption at the first so-called quarterwavelength resonance of a single rigidly-backed high-porous layer, the thickness of the material is strongly related to its flow resistivity. In particular, perfect sound absorption is observed when the quarter-wavelength resonance is around the characteristic Biot frequency of the high-porous media. We found that the optimal thickness of the layer is 4.64 smaller than the perfectly absorbed wavelength when using one-parameter empirical models for the effective parameters of the high-porous material. Then, we analyze the behavior of the structure for oblique angles of incidence, showing that perfect sound absorption is also produced for other incident angles and frequencies. Second, an air gap is introduced between the high-porous layer and the rigid backing. The gap allows to produce perfect sound absorption for structures thicker than the optimal one and for media with large intrinsic losses, i.e., for materials with high flow resistivity. Finally, optimized multilayer structures are proposed, which present broadband and perfect sound absorption. The existence of perfect absorption is related to the impedance matching, which is produced when the intrinsic losses of the system exactly compensate the leakage of the structure due to its resonance. Thus, to observe perfect sound absorption, in addition to and material properties, the total thickness of any multilayered porous structure is constrained to its quarter-wavelength resonance because of the lack of deep-subwavelength resonance in the system.},

  abstract = {Poroelastic materials are essential to engineers to improve the sound and vibration properties of a product. The most common mathematical model that describes the vibro-acoustics of these materials is the Biot theory, which considers the fully coupled behavior of a homogenized solid phase, based on the structural skeleton, and a homogenized fluid phase, describing the inter-penetrating fluid. This article focuses on an adaptive higher order finite element implementation to solve poroelastic models. Owing to the presence of several wave solutions, namely, two compressional wave types and one shear wave type, it is difficult to define clear meshing guidelines a priori for poroelastic material modeling and trial and error is required to ensure reliable results. Multiple scales may be present, and local resonance phenomena may significantly modify the resolution requirements in certain frequency bands. In order to remedy this, and to be able to deliver a (nearly) mesh-independent solution, a physics based adaptivity mechanism is developed which determines the distribution of (directional) element orders at each frequency prior to the calculation, to reach a user-defined target error. The resulting approach is verified for different element topologies and is further applied to relevant applications of poroelastic materials in vibro-acoustics.},

  abstract = {Hemp-lime concrete is a sustainable alternative to standard wall construction materials. It boasts excellent hygrothermal properties in part deriving from its porous structure. This paper investigates the acoustic properties of hemp-lime concrete, using binders developed from hydrated lime and pozzolans as well as hydraulic and cementicious binders. To assess the acoustic absorption of hemp-lime walls, as they are commonly finished in practical construction, wall sections are rendered and the resulting impact on absorption is evaluated. Hemp-concretes with lime-pozzolan binders display superior acoustic properties relative to more hydraulic binders. These are diminished when rendered, as the open surface porosity is affected, however hemp-lime construction offers the potential to meet standard and guideline targets for spaces requiring acoustic treatment.},

A nearly total absorption over a wide frequency band can be obtained for thin structures, even for frequencies below the quarter wavelength resonances i.e., in a sub-wavelength regime. The high absorption performances of this material are due to the interplay of usual visco-thermal losses, local resonances and trapped modes. The density of resonant and trapped modes in this dissipative porous layer, is a key parameter for broadband absorption. The best configurations and critical coupling conditions are found by genetic algorithm optimization. Several types of resonators are included gradually in the studied configurations (split-rings, Helmholtz resonators, back cavities) with increasing complexity. The optimization leads to a metaporous structure with a 2-cm sub-wavelength layer thickness, exhibiting a nearly total absorption between 1800 Hz and 7000 Hz. The influence of the incidence angle on the absorption properties is also shown.},

  abstract = {The theory of waves in an infinitely long cylindrical rod was discussed by Pochhammer in 1876 in a well-known paper. The somewhat simpler problem of two-dimensional waves in a solid bounded by parallel planes was considered by Lord Rayleigh and by the present writer{\ddag} in 1889. The main object in these various investigations was to verify, or to ascertain small corrections to, the ordinary theory of the vibrations of thin rods or plates, and the wave-length was accordingly assumed in the end to be great in comparison with the thickness. It occurred to me some time ago that a further examination of the two-dimensional problem was desirable for more than one reason. In the first place, the number of cases in which the various types of vibration of a solid, none of whose dimensions is regarded as small, have been studied is so restricted that any addition to it would have some degree of interest, if merely as a contribution to elastic theory. Again, modern seismology has suggested various questions relating to waves and vibrations in an elastic stratum imagined as resting on matter of a different elasticity and density. These questions naturally present great mathematical difficulties, and it seemed unpromising to attempt any further discussion of them unless the comparatively simple problem which forms the subject of this paper should be found to admit of a practical solution. In itself it has, of course, no bearing on the questions referred to.},

Hladky-Hennion et\hphantom{,}al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 90, 3356--3367 (1991)]. This paper presents a new extension of this technique to the analysis of the propagation of plane acoustic waves in passive periodic materials without losses and describes with particular emphasis its application to doubly periodic materials containing different types of inclusions. In the proposed approach, only the unit cell of the periodic material has to be meshed, thanks to Bloch--Floquet relations. The modeling of these materials provides dispersion curves from which results of physical interest can be easily extracted: identification of propagation modes, cutoff frequencies, passbands, stopbands, as well as effective homogeneous properties. In this paper, the general method is first described, and particularly the aspects related to the periodicity. Then a test example is given for which analytical results exist. This example is followed by detailed presentations of finite element results, in the case of periodic materials containing inclusions or cylindrical pores. The homogenized properties of porous materials are determined with the help of an anisotropic model, in the large wavelength limit. A validation has been carried out with periodically perforated plates, the resonance frequencies of which have been measured. The efficiency and the versatility of the method is thus clearly demonstrated.},

If the bubbles are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, a total band gap opens near the Minnaert resonance frequency. If they are arranged in the diamond structure, which one obtains by simply adding a second bubble to the unit cell, one finds an additional branch with a negative slope (optical branch). For a single specific frequency, the medium behaves as if its refractive index (relative to water) is exactly \$n=-1\$. We show that a slab of this material can be used to design a three three-dimensional flat lens. We also report super-resolution focusing in the near field of the slab and illustrate its potential for imaging in three dimensions.},

It is shown that the dispersion relation is generally shifted in the complex \$(k,{\textbackslash}omega)\$ plane, with \$k\$ the wavenumber and \${\textbackslash}omega\$ the angular frequency. The value of the shift is obtained explicitly as a function of the perturbation of material constants accounting for loss. The method is shown to predict correctly the transformation of the complex band structure \$k({\textbackslash}omega)\$. Several models of the dispersion relation near a symmetry point of the Brillouin zone are analyzed. A lower bound for the group velocity, related to the local shape of the band around symmetry points, is derived for each case.},

Below the sound cone, they are transversely evanescent on both sides of the line of inclusions. Guidance is then achieved without any cladding surrounding the segmented core. Inclusions usually impose definite boundary conditions, resulting in a single guided band. We consider instead the case of permeable, slow inclusions inside a fast medium. Introducing the concept of guided quasi-normal modes, we obtain the complex dispersion relation taking into account radiation at infinity. We thus show that multiple bands of leaky Rayleigh-Bloch waves appear and that guided bound states in the continuum arise as a result of the combination of symmetry and periodicity.},

The theoretical model is favorably validated by finite element (FE) simulations and experimental measurements. The proposed ALPM shows an excellent subwavelength low-frequency sound absorption performance: the material thickness is only 1/22 of the sound wavelength in air at the sound absorption peak frequency. The electronic--acoustic analogy method proves that this metamaterial can achieve a perfect impedance match with air at low frequencies. The FE simulations for energy transmission and dissipation reveal its sound absorption mechanisms, showing a frequency-dependent sound transmission path characteristic. Moreover, the influence of the slit folding number on the sound absorption is analyzed and it shows that a longer slit corresponds to a lower-frequency peak. This work is valuable to guide the novel design of acoustic metamaterials for the subwavelength low-frequency sound absorption.},

This paper presents a review of the main developments of the matrix techniques, and their use in response and modal models, with emphasis on ultrasonics applications.},

  abstract = {A method is presented by which the wavenumbers for a one-dimensional waveguide can be predicted from a finite element (FE) model. The method involves postprocessing a conventional, but low order, FE model, the mass and stiffness matrices of which are typically found using a conventional FE package. This is in contrast to the most popular previous waveguide/FE approach, sometimes termed the spectral finite element approach, which requires new spectral element matrices to be developed. In the approach described here, a section of the waveguide is modeled using conventional FE software and the dynamic stiffness matrix formed. A periodicity condition is applied, the wavenumbers following from the eigensolution of the resulting transfer matrix. The method is described, estimation of wavenumbers, energy, and group velocity discussed, and numerical examples presented. These concern wave propagation in a beam and a simply supported plate strip, for which analytical solutions exist, and the more complex case of a viscoelastic laminate, which involves postprocessing an ANSYS FE model. The method is seen to yield accurate results for the wavenumbers and group velocities of both propagating and evanescent waves.},

Accordingly, isotropic media are characterized simply by scalar constitutive parameters that relate the induction field phasors                              and                              to the primitive field phasors                              and                              . In contrast, anisotropic media exhibit directionally dependent electromagnetic properties, such that                              is not aligned with                              and/or                              is not aligned with                              . Furthermore, recent advances have focused attention on bianisotropic media wherein both                              and                              are anisotropically coupled to both                              and                              . Therefore, dyadics (i.e., second-rank Cartesian tensors) are needed to relate the primitive and the induction field phasors in both anisotropic and bianisotropic media. Correspondingly, these media exhibit a vastly more diverse range of phenomena than do isotropic media. A consequence of this wealth of interesting properties is that electromagnetic analyses are considerably more complicated for anisotropic and bianisotropic media than for isotropic media. In this article, anisotropic and bianisotropic media are discussed in terms of their constitutive dyadics and spacetime symmetries. Planewave propagation, dyadic Green functions, and the conceptualization of anisotropic and bianisotropic media via homogenization are described. A brief account of anisotropic and bianisotropic behavior in nonlinear media concludes this article.},

  abstract = {The application of shift cell technique is presented and discussed for periodic porous media described with equivalent fluid models: as it can be found in literature, it consists in a reformulation of classical Floquet-Bloch (F-B) conditions, in which the phase shift of the boundary conditions, related to wave propagation, is integrated into the partial derivative operator. Consequently, the periodicity is included in the overall behavior of the structure, while continuity conditions are imposed at the edges of the unit cell. Its major advantage stands in allowing the introduction of a generic frequency dependence of porous material behavior, through the resolution a quadratic eigenvalue problem, providing an efficient way to compute the dispersion curves of a porous material modeled as an equivalent fluid. A validation and a computational cost comparison are performed between the shift cell technique and the classical F-B approach, pointing out that the first can provide, among its other advantages, a sensible computational time reduction for this kind of analyses. The derivation of the equivalent acoustic properties of the unit cell from its dispersion characteristics is also investigated. To this aim, group velocity matrix formulation and a branch-tracking algorithm are described. Some test cases are used for validating the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {The current study is a bibliographic observation on prevailing tendencies in the development of acoustic absorption by natural fiber composites. Despite having less detrimental environmental effects and thorough availability, natural fibers are still unsuitable for wide implementation in industrial purposes. Some shortcomings such as the presence of moisture contents, thicker diameter, and lower antifungus quality hold up the progress of natural fiber composites in staying competitive with synthetic composites. The review indicates the importance of the pretreatment of fresh natural fiber to overcome these shortcomings. However, the pretreatment of natural fiber causes the removal of moisture contents which results in the decrease of its acoustic absorption performance. Incorporation of granular materials in treated fiber composite is expected to play a significant role as a replacement for moisture contents. This review aims to investigate the acoustic absorption behavior of natural fiber composites due to the incorporation of granular materials. It is intended that this review will provide an overview of the analytical approaches for the modeling of acoustic wave propagation through the natural fiber composites. The possible influential factors of fibers and grains were described in this study for the enhancement of low frequency acoustic absorption of the composites.},

The nature of these dissipative materials is initially considered to be arbitrary, i.e., poroelastic, viscoelastic, or viscoacoustic. For a given frequency, the complex wavenumbers as well as the physical fields, which are further used to evaluate the Poynting vectors and analyze the energy flux, are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The latter arises from a set of discretized equations of motion and appropriate boundary (coupling) conditions. These equations of motion and boundary (coupling) conditions are imposed by the nature of the material composing each layer of the structure. A focus is made on poroelastic layers. The dispersion relation of a two-layer elastic--poroelastic structure is analyzed, as well as the energy flows in the structure. The results as calculated with the present spectral collocation method are validated against those obtained with a classical complex root-finding (M{\"u}ller) method and experiments.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical method for analyzing elastic wave scattering by multi-layered periodic structures in two dimensions. The proposed method is based on the boundary element method (BEM) and scattering matrix representing a relationship between incoming and outgoing waves in the vicinity of a periodic structure. First, we define the scattering matrix using a plane-wave expansion of the solution of the elastic problem. Then, we show the integral formulae that convert the solution of a system of boundary integral equations into elements of the scattering matrix. The proposed scattering matrix method with the BEM enables us to reduce the scattering problem in a multi-layered structure to a purely algebraic one in terms of the scattering matrix of each layer, resulting into less requirement in computational resources than in the methods which are based on the meshing of an entire boundary and solution of the corresponding boundary integral equations. Such a procedure called layerdoubling method is implemented in a numerically stable manner based on the eigendecomposition of a relevant matrix. Moreover, some scattering properties and phononic band structures of semi-infinite phononic crystals are yielded through an asymptotic analysis on the scattering matrix. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method can solve accurately scattering problems and also can calculate some related eigenmodes including the Bloch modes and guided waves within stacked structures.},

Here, Rayleigh--Bloch waves are studied for line arrays of sound-hard circular scatterers embedded in a two-dimensional acoustic medium, for which it has recently been shown that Rayleigh--Bloch waves exist for higher frequencies than previously thought. Moreover, it was shown that Rayleigh--Bloch waves can cut off (disappear) and cut on (reappear), and additional Rayleigh--Bloch waves can cut on and interact with the existing ones. These complicated behaviours are reconsidered using a family of quasi-periodic Green's functions that allow particular plane-wave components to become unbounded away from the array. The Green's function formulation is combined with the block Sakurai--Sugiura method to trace the trajectories of the Rayleigh--Bloch wavenumbers as they swap between Riemann sheets that are categorized according to the unbounded plane wave(s). A detailed analysis is presented for three different scatterer radius values, and contrasting qualitative behaviours are identified. The findings are consistent with those published previously, extend to higher frequencies than allowed by the previous approach, and provide new understanding of Rayleigh--Bloch waves around the critical frequency intervals where they cut on/cut off/interact.},

  abstract = {Leaky waves have been among the most active I . I N T R O D U C T I O N areas of research in microwave engineering over the second half of the 20th century. They have been shown to dominate the near-field of several open wave-guiding structures, of great interest to tailor their radiation, guidance and filtering properties. The elegant theoretical analyses and deep physical insights in this area, developed in an era in which computational resources were limited, represent a fundamental scientific legacy that is still extremely relevant in today's engineering society and beyond. In this regard, the relevance of leaky-wave concepts has been increasingly recognized in recent times over a broader scientific community, including optics and physics societies. In this paper, after revisiting the fundamental concepts of leaky-wave theory, we discuss and connect different relevant research activities in which leaky-wave concepts have been applied, with the goal of facilitating multidisciplinary interactions on these topics. In addition to the canonical microwave applications of leaky waves, particular attention is devoted to a few areas of interest in modern optics, such as directive optical antennas, extraordinary optical transmission, and embedded scattering eigenvalues, in which leaky waves play a fundamental role.},

  abstract = {It is found that leaky backward Lamb waves, i.e. waves with negative energy-flux velocity, propagating in a plate submerged in a liquid possess extraordinary energy properties distinguishing them from any other type of waves in isotropic media. Namely, the total time-averaged energy flux along the waveguide axis is equal to zero for these waves due to opposite directions of the longitudinal energy fluxes in the adjacent media. This property gives rise to the fundamental question of how to define and calculate correctly the energy velocity in such an unusual case. The procedure of calculation based on incomplete integration of the energy flux density over the plate thickness alone is applied. The derivative of the angular frequency with respect to the wave vector, usually referred to as the group velocity, happens to be close to the energy velocity defined by this mean in that part of the frequency range where the backward mode exists in the free plate. The existence region of the backward mode is formally increased for the submerged plate in comparison to the free plate as a result of the liquid-induced hybridization of propagating and nonpropagating (evanescent) Lamb modes. It is shown that the Rayleigh's principle (i.e. equipartition of total time-averaged kinetic and potential energies for time-harmonic acoustic fields) is violated due to the leakage of Lamb waves, in spite of considering nondissipative media.},

  abstract = {Acoustic fields scattered by poroelastic materials contain key information about the materials' pore structure and elastic properties. Therefore, such materials are often characterised with inverse methods that use acoustic measurements. However, it has been shown that results from many existing inverse characterisation methods agree poorly. One reason is that inverse methods are typically sensitive to even small uncertainties in a measurement setup, but these uncertainties are difficult to model and hence often neglected. In this paper, we study characterising poroelastic materials in the Bayesian framework, where measurement uncertainties can be taken into account, and which allows us to quantify uncertainty in the results. Using the finite element method, we simulate measurements where ultrasonic waves are incident on a water-saturated poroelastic material in normal and oblique angles. We consider uncertainties in the incidence angle and level of measurement noise, and then explore the solution of the Bayesian inverse problem, the posterior density, with an adaptive parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results show that both the elastic and pore structure parameters can be feasibly estimated from ultrasonic measurements.},

The acoustical characterisation of poroelastic materials based on various measurements is typically carried out by minimizing a cost functional of model residuals, such as the least squares functional. With a limited number of unknown parameters, least squares type approaches can provide both reliable parameter and error estimates. With an increasing number of parameters, both the least squares parameter estimates, and in particular, the error estimates often become unreliable. In this paper, we consider the estimation of the material parameters of an inhomogeneous poroelastic (Biot) plate in the Bayesian framework for inverse problems. We carry out reflection and transmission measurements and estimate 11 poroelastic parameters as well as 4 measurement setup-related nuisance parameters. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the computational inference to assess the actual uncertainty of the estimated parameters. The results suggest that the proposed approach for poroelastic material characterisation can reveal the heterogeneities in the object and yield reliable parameter and uncertainty estimates.},

The interaction causes resonant enhancement of fields in the waveguide and anomalous transmission of energy across it. A guided mode is an eigenfunction of a member of the family of operators in the FloquetBloch decomposition of the periodic differential operator underlying the waveguide structure. The theory of existence or nonexistence of modes in ideal lossless waveguides is founded on variational principles. The mechanism for resonant scattering behavior is the dissolution of an embedded eigenvalue into the continuous spectrum, which corresponds to the destruction of a guided mode of a waveguide, upon perturbation of the wavevector or the material properties or geometry of the structure. Analytic perturbation of functions that unify the guided modes and the extended scattering states gives rise to asymptotic formulas for transmission anomalies.},

Currently, the need for tools predicting the acoustical and structural behaviors of such structures is considerably increasing. In this paper, such a tool is presented. It is applied to the sound transmission loss through multilayer structures made from a combination of elastic, air, and poroelastic materials. The presented approach is based on a three-dimensional finite element model. It uses classical elastic and fluid elements to model the elastic and fluid media. For the poroelastic material, it uses a two-field displacement formulation derived from the Biot theory. Furthermore, it couples with a boundary element approach to account, when important, for fluid--structure coupling and to calculate the transmission loss through the multilayer structure. Numerical predictions of the transmission loss through a poroelastic material sandwiched between two finite elastic plates are presented for various configurations. It is shown that the unbonded/bonded configuration gives better transmission loss. Also, comparisons with laterally infinite double panels and with an equivalent fluid approach for the porous material are presented. It is shown that these two simplified models lead to erroneous predictions at low frequencies and for certain design configurations, respectively.},

These squares can then be refined to any prespecified rational width. Furthermore, the algorithms can associate with each square the multiplicity of the unique root of G contained in that square. Exact arithmetic is used so that all computational errors are eliminated. The system is self-sufficient in the sense that no starting approximations are needed, and no user interaction during computation is required. The methods used ensure termination of the algorithms with the desired squares regardless of such aspects as multiple roots, roots which are distinct but very close together, or polynomials with high condition numbers.

It has been shown that widely accepted assumptions concerning the similarities between the classical Lamb wave spectrum and the LLW spectrum are not valid as the fluid density approaches that of the solid. Recent experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that there is a strong anomaly in the reflectance of composite plates in water. This anomaly is related to the details of the complex LLW spectrum. The spectrum is composed of both the familiar propagating Lamb wave branches and the mostly imaginary, nonpropagating branches. From the character of the complex spectrum, it is demonstrated that topological changes in the fundamental symmetric mode are related to its nearness to the first complex branch of the spectrum. Increasing the fluid--solid density ratio leads to interaction between these modes and to mutual interchange between portions of their branches. As the density ratio increases from zero to infinity, the complex spectrum is gradually transformed from a classical Lamb wave spectrum to one appropriate for a plate with zero normal surface displacements.},

This book will lead to fresh creative ideas for use in new inspection procedures. Although the mathematics is sometimes sophisticated, the book can also be read by managers without detailed understanding of the concepts as it can be read from a 'black box' point of view. Overall, the material presented on wave mechanics - in particular, guided wave mechanics - establishes a framework for the creative data collection and signal processing needed to solve many problems using ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring. The book can be used as a reference in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation by professionals and as a textbook for seniors and graduate students.

This complementary wave grows instead of decays with propagation and is time-reversed compared to the leaky wave. Moreover, this growing wave has not yet been observed experimentally, perhaps due to difficulty of its excitation. Experimental observation of this wave was one goal of our work. The second goal was to study mirror reflection of an acoustic beam of special shape when the incident angle is equal to the Rayleigh critical angle. An obliquely incident beam is known to split after reflection into two components: a specular beam and a broad beam generated by the leaky waves. The interference of these two components results in "Schoch displacement" of the reflected beam along the interface and overall beam broadening. Our hypothesis was that by time reversing the reflection at the critical angle, the reflection beam can be made narrower rather than broader.},

Biot's theory was used for describing the dynamic behavior of aniso\- tropic poroelastic material. Assuming the structures is homogeneous along its axial direction, the Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) was successfully employed in procedures using isogeometric Galerkin and colloca\- tion methods. The numeral studies showed that the SAIGA-G method using high continuity NURBS basis allowed to significantly improve the accuracy as well as the convergence rate of the wave dispersion solutions in compared with the conventional SAFE method, which used Lagrange basis functions. Otherwise, the SAIGA-C method was shown to have similar performance in terms of accuracy to the SAFE method.},

In this paper, in order to optimize this sound absorption characteristics, a new type of underwater sound absorption metamaterials with multi-resonator are proposed based on the coupled resonance mechanism. The underwater sound absorption characteristics of the proposed metamaterials with steel plate backing are investigated by finite element method (FEM). The effect of coupled resonance between the resonators on the sound absorption characteristics of metamaterials is investigated. In addition, the effect of the geometric structure of steel plate backing on the sound absorption characteristics is studied as well. Numerical results show that the proposed metamaterials have many advantages over the conventional anechoic coating in underwater sound absorption due to the coupled resonance effect. Moreover, the steel plate backing has a significant effect on the sound absorption characteristics of the proposed metamaterials, especially, in the low frequency range.},

The resonator geometry is considered in the limit as the wall thickness becomes very large compared with the aperture width (the specially-scaled limit). In this regime, the existing treatment in Part I, with updated parameters, is found to return spurious spectral behaviour. We derive a regularised system which overcomes this issue and also derive compact asymptotic descriptions for the low-frequency dispersion equation in this setting. In the speciallyscaled limit, our asymptotic dispersion equation not only recovers the first band surface but also extends to high, but still subwavelength, frequencies. A homogenisation treatment is outlined for describing the effective bulk modulus and effective density tensor of the resonator array for all wall thicknesses. We demonstrate that specially-scaled resonators are able to achieve exceptionally low Helmholtz resonant frequencies, and present closed-form expressions for determining these explicitly. We anticipate that the analytical expressions and the formulation outlined here may prove useful in industrial and other applications.},

  abstract = {In this article, a general method is proposed to model layered acoustical systems with two-by-two transfer matrices, and further, to solve for their acoustic absorption, reflection, and transmission coefficients. Since the proposed method uses the matrix representation of various layers and interfaces, as in the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), the equation system can be established efficiently. However, the traditional TMM can become unstable when there is a large disparity between the magnitudes of the waves traveling in opposite directions within the layers (i.e., at higher frequencies, for a thick layer, or for extreme parameter values). In such cases, the contribution of the most attenuated wave can be masked by numerical errors and can induce instability when solving the system. Therefore, in the proposed method, the accuracy of the wave attenuation terms is ensured by decomposing each layer's transfer matrix and reformulating the equation system. This method can be used to couple different layer types in a general way and is easy to assemble and implement with numerical code. The predicted acoustic properties of layered systems calculated using the proposed method have been validated by comparison with those predicted by previously-existing methods.},

  abstract = {Piezoelectric shunt damping technology has been applied in the field of underwater sound absorption in recent years. In order to achieve broadband echo reduction, semiactive control of sound absorption of multi-layered piezoelectric coating by shunt damping is significant. In this paper, a practical method is proposed to control the underwater sound absorption coefficients of piezoelectric coating layers by combining design of the shunt impedance that allows certain sound absorption coefficients at setting frequencies. A one-dimensional electro-acoustic model of the piezoelectric coating and the backing is established based on the Mason equivalent circuit theory. First, the shunt impedance of the coating is derived under the constraint of sound absorption coefficient at one frequency. Then, taking the 1--3 piezoelectric composite coating as an example, the sound absorption properties of the coating shunted to the designed shunt impedance are investigated. Next, on the basis of that, an iterative method for two constrained frequencies and an optimizing algorithm for multiple constrained frequencies are provided for combining design of the shunt impedances. At last, an experimental sample with four piezoelectric material layers is manufactured, of which the sound absorption coefficients are measured in an impedance tube. The experimental results show good agreement with the finite element simulation results. It is proved that a serial R--L circuit can control the peak frequency, maximum and bandwidth of the sound absorption coefficient and the combining R--L circuits shunted to multiple layers can control the sound absorption coefficients at multiple frequencies.},

Various fibrous materials including inorganic and metallic fibers, synthetic fibers, natural fibers, and nanofibrous membranes for noise reduction are reviewed. Inorganic and metallic fibers have the advantages of corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance and long service life. The tailored cross-sections of synthetic fibers such as circle, hollow and triangle are beneficial to improve acoustic absorption properties.

  abstract = {Elastic guided waves are of interest for inspecting structures due to their ability to propagate over long distances. In numerous applications, the guiding structure is surrounded by a solid matrix that can be considered as unbounded in the transverse directions. The physics of waves in such an open waveguide significantly differs from a closed waveguide, i.e. for a bounded cross-section. Except for trapped modes, part of the energy is radiated in the surrounding medium, yielding attenuated modes along the axis called leaky modes. These leaky modes have often been considered in non destructive testing applications, which require waves of low attenuation in order to maximize the inspection distance. The main difficulty with numerical modeling of open waveguides lies in the unbounded nature of the geometry in the transverse direction. This difficulty is particularly severe due to the unusual behavior of leaky modes: while attenuating along the axis, such modes exponentially grow along the transverse direction. A simple numerical procedure consists in using absorbing layers of artificially growing viscoelasticity, but large layers may be required. The goal of this paper is to explore another approach for the computation of trapped and leaky modes in open waveguides. The approach combines the so-called semi-analytical finite element method and a perfectly matched layer technique. Such an approach has already been successfully applied in scalar acoustics and electromagnetism. It is extended here to open elastic waveguides, which raises specific difficulties. In this paper, two-dimensional stratified waveguides are considered. As it reveals a rich structure, the numerical eigenvalue spectrum is analyzed in a first step. This allows to clarify the spectral objects calculated with the method, including radiation modes, and their dependency on the perfectly matched layer parameters. In a second step, numerical dispersion curves of trapped and leaky modes are compared to analytical results.},

  abstract = {Separations of up- and down-going as well as of P- and S-waves are often a part of processing of multicomponent recorded data and propagating wavefields. Most previous methods for separating up/down propagating wavefields are expensive because of the requirement to save time steps to perform Fourier transforms over time. An alternate approach for separation of up-and down-going waves, based on extrapolation of complex data traces is extended from acoustic to elastic, and combined with P- and S-wave decomposition by decoupled propagation. This preserves all the information in the original data and eliminates the need for a Fourier transform over time, thereby significantly reducing the storage cost and improving computational efficiency. Wavefield decomposition is applied to synthetic elastic VSP data and propagating wavefield snapshots. Poynting vectors obtained from the particle velocity and stress fields after P/S and up/down decompositions are much more accurate than those without because interference between the corresponding wavefronts is significantly reduced. Elastic reverse time migration with the P/S and up/down decompositions indicated significant improvement compared with those without decompositions, when applied to elastic data from a portion of the Marmousi2 model.},

  abstract = {Open-celled silicon carbide (SiC) foam has been proven of a promising underwater acoustic absorption material. However, further improvement of its sound absorption capacity especially at low frequency is restricted by the acoustic impedance mismatch between the foam material and the water surrounding it. How to tailor the existing SiC foam in order to achieve an optimized impedance match is a key issue. In this work, the underwater acoustic absorption performance of open-celled SiC foam is studied by both analytical and experimental methods. First, based on Zwikker--Kosten's theory, the modified Johnson--Allard (J--A) model is proposed to analytically predict the absorption performance of liquid-saturated SiC foam. Then three approaches including (i) backing the test samples by a 30-mm-thick air cavity, (ii) enclosing a certain amount of water and (iii) filling the samples with silicon oil are proposed to improve the underwater sound absorption performance of SiC foam. The underwater acoustic absorbency of the silicon oil filled SiC foam is significantly improved, especially in the low frequency band. A sound absorption coefficient near unity is achieved by this manner over a significant portion of the investigated frequency range, eg. 750--4000 Hz. The foam partially filled with water also shows enhanced sound absorbency at low frequency, but the foams backed by air gap and saturated fully by water display degraded sound absorption capacity.},

If a hard-backed porous layer contains periodical arrangements of rigid partitions that are coordinated parallel and perpendicular to the direction of incoming sound waves, the lower bound of the effective sound absorption can be lowered much more and the overall absorption performance enhanced. The consequence of rigid partitioning in a porous layer is to make the first thickness resonance mode in the layer appear at much lower frequencies compared to that in the original homogeneous porous layer with the same thickness. Moreover, appropriate partitioning yields multiple thickness resonances with higher absorption peaks through impedance matching. The physics of the partitioned porous layer, or the metaporous layer, is theoretically investigated in this study.},

The present review is based on the physics perspective as the coherent basis of this diverse field. For conventional absorbers, viscous dissipation and heat conduction at the fluidsolid interface, when expressed through micro-geometric parameters, yield an effective medium description of porous media and micro-perforated panels as effectual sound absorbers. Local resonances and their geometric and symmetry constraints serve as the framework for surveying a variety of acoustic metamaterial absorbers that can realize previously unattainable absorption spectra with subwavelength-scale structures. These structures include decorated membrane resonators, degenerate resonators, hybrid resonators, and coiled Fabry-Pe{\textasciiacute}rot and Helmholtz resonators. As the acoustic response of any structure or material must obey the causality principle, the implied constraint---which relates the absorption spectrum of a sample to its required minimum thickness---is presented as a means to delineate what is ultimately possible for sound-absorbing structures. The review concludes by describing a recently reported strategy for realizing structures that can exhibit customdesigned absorption spectra, as well as its implementation in the form of a broadband absorber with a thickness that is close to the minimum value as dictated by causality.},

  abstract = {The propagation of evanescent waves in hybrid poroelastic metamaterials is investigated by considering interface effects. Hybrid metamaterials consist of a single-phased (acoustic or elastic) medium and a poroelastic medium. To establish the finite element model of elastic/poroelastic and fluid/poroelastic interfaces, weak integral forms of wave equations for elastic, fluid, and poroelastic media and boundary conditions at the interfaces between different media are first given. Next, the expressions for displacement and pressure in the frame of Bloch's theorem are substituted into the dynamical equations to obtain general forms suitable for periodic metamaterials, from which the complex band structure and the frequency response of hybrid metamaterials are calculated. The influence of geometrical and material parameters, as well as the viscosity of the pore fluid on the propagation of elastic waves are discussed. The results and discussions show that flat bands and narrow locally resonant band gaps appear for elastic/poroelastic metamaterials. A quasi-resonance Bragg band gap is formed in the case of an elastic inclusion in a poroelastic matrix. Furthermore, a transition from an avoided crossing to a wave-number band gap is obtained by adjusting the geometrical and material parameters of the elastic inclusion. For the case of fluid inclusion in a poroelastic matrix with the open-pore interface, a cut-off frequency for the fast longitudinal wave is observed. However, only an avoided crossing is produced for the sealed-pore interface. For both cases, the phase velocity of the shear vertical (SV) wave decreases faster than that of the slow longitudinal wave as the radius of the inclusion increases. When the viscosity of the pore fluid is considered for elastic inclusion in a poroelastic matrix, the transmission dip at the `quasi-resonance Bragg' band gap disappears. However, the transmission dip in the locally resonant band gap of the SV wave becomes slightly shallower and smoother than in the inviscid case. This study is relevant to practical applications of hybrid single-phased and poroelastic metamaterials, e.g., for coastal engineering and civil engineering.},

In this paper, we derive two theoretical requirements for broadband perfect absorption of low-frequency waterborne sound by ultrathin acoustic metasurface under a finite-thickness steel plate followed by semi-infinite air. Based on the theoretical requirements, an acoustic metasurface, a rubber layer embedded periodically with cavities, is inversely designed to achieve perfect absorption at 500\,Hz. The metasurface is as thin as 1\% of the working wavelength and maintains a substantially high absorptance over a relatively broad bandwidth. The perfect absorption peak is attributed to the overall resonance mode of the metasurface/steel plate system. Besides, high absorption can still be achieved even if the loss factor of the given rubber material cannot meet the ideal requirement. Finally, a strategy to utilize the inherent frequency-dependent characteristics of dynamic parameters of rubber material is suggested to achieve an ultra-broadband perfect absorption. When the frequency-dependent characteristics of the given rubber matrix cannot meet the theoretical requirements, a broadband super-absorption can still be realized by properly designing the frequency position of perfect absorption of the cavity-based metasurface.},

A single AMR embedded in a porous layer could reach perfect absorption (PA) at the resonance frequency, and it can be easily tuned by adjusting the inner radius of AMR. With four AMRs in the porous layer, a high absorption ({$>$}80\%) is obtained in the frequency range from 180 Hz to 550 Hz, while the thickness of the porous layer is only 1 =10 of the relevant wavelength at 300 Hz. The broadband and high absorption performances are due to the interferences of the low-frequency resonances of the AMRs and the energy trapping between the AMRs and the rigid backings. The finite element simulations are experimentally validated. Moreover, the broadband low-frequency absorption is robust under various oblique incidence even at large incident angles. The effects of the acoustic parameters of the porous layer on the absorption properties are also discussed. The absorbers should have high potential for the practical applications in buildings, aircrafts and automobiles due to their ease of fabrication, ultra-thin, and robust high-efficiency.},
