It is shown that the dependence of the amplitude on the distance from the layer is exponential, close to the layer, and the same as for the surface wave related to the pole located at an angle of incidence {\texttheta}p close to {$\pi$}/2. The localization of this pole obtained for a thin layer from this property is compared to measurements performed with a recent transfer function method based on pressure measurements at different source-receiver distances. In this paper, we evaluate cos{$\mkern1mu\theta$}p from pressure measurements on an axis perpendicular to the surface of the layer at small source-receiver offsets, thus this method can be used with small sample sizes.},

Furthermore, for each of these three families of methods, we present original procedures for solving the high-frequency multiple scattering problem. Computational examples are given, in particular for finite periodic structures calculations. Difficulties for solving such problems are explained, showing that many serious simulation problems are still open.},

The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves. The proposed SAFE formulation is applied to several examples, including anisotropic viscoelastic layered plates, composite-to-composite adhesive joints and railroad tracks.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the velocity of the propagation of energy in guided waves in plates. The motivation of the work comes from the practical observation that the conventional approach to predicting the velocities of pulses or wave packets, that is, the simple group velocity calculation, breaks down when the guided waves are attenuative. The conventional approach is therefore not valid for guided waves in absorbing materials or for leaky waves. The paper presents a theoretical derivation of an expression to predict the energy velocity of guided waves in an isotropic plate, based on the integration of the Poynting energy vectors. When applied to modes with no attenuation, it is shown analytically from this expression that the energy velocity is always identical to the group velocity. On the other hand, when applied to attenuative modes, numerical integration of the expression to yield the true energy velocity shows that this can differ quite significantly from the group velocity. Experimental validation of the expression is achieved by measuring the velocity of wave packets in an absorbing plate, under such conditions when the energy velocity differs substantially from the group velocity. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions and the measurements. The paper also shows the Poynting vectors in the various model studies, and some interesting phenomena relating to their directions.},

This design tool is applied on a graded porous medium composed of a periodic arrangement of ordered unit cells allowing one to link the effective acoustic properties to its geometry. The best microgeometry continuous gradient providing the optimal acoustic reflection and/or transmission is designed via a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm. The acoustic performances of the so-designed continuous graded material are discussed with respect to the optimized homogeneous, i.e., nongraded and monotonically graded material. The numerical results show a shifting of the perfect absorption peak to lower frequencies or a widening of the perfect absorption frequency range for graded materials when compared to uniform ones.

  abstract = {This Letter reports a folded metaporous surface optimized to achieve sub-wavelength and broadband perfect absorption. Its unit cell is composed of four different helicoidal cavities filled by porous media, which are structured and quasi-isotropic micro-lattices with a variable lattice constant. The effective thickness and intrinsic losses of each helicoidal cavity can be adjusted independently by varying their macroand micro-structures, namely, the number of revolution of the folded structure and the lattice constant of the micro-lattice. An analytical model predicting the physical properties of this metaporous surface is developed. The macro- and micro-structures are then jointly optimized for sub-wavelength broadband perfect absorption. Finally, the system is 3D printed and experimentally tested. The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with the theory and show an almost perfect absorption over a frequency range out of reach for the homogeneous constitutive porous medium and the only helicoidal cavities.},

Reducing noise by using sound absorption materials is an important approach to lessen the harm of noise pollution. As the most abundantly used materials, porous materials combine the properties of lightweight, wide absorption frequency range and highly sound absorption ability, and they hold great potential in the field of sound absorption. In this review, the recent progress in the design and fabrication of porous sound absorption materials is summarized and highlighted. This review covers the introduction of the sound absorption mechanism and evolution of prediction models for porous sound absorption materials, and the research and development of the design concepts and fabrication of sound absorption foams and fibrous sound absorption materials. The review concludes with some perspectives and outlook for the porous sound absorption materials.},

A semi-analytical model is described and used for predicting the dispersion curves (phase velocity, energy velocity, and complex wave-number) and the through-thickness distribution fields (displacement, stress, and energy flow). Guided modes propagating along a test-sandwich plate are shown to be quite different than classical Lamb modes, because this structure does not have the mirror symmetry, contrary to most of composite material plates. Moreover, the viscoelastic material properties imply complex roots of the dispersion equation to be found that lead to connections between some of the dispersion curves, meaning that some of the modes get coupled together. Gradual variation from zero to nominal values of the imaginary parts of the viscoelastic moduli shows that the mode coupling depends on the level of material viscoelasticity, except for one particular case where this phenomenon exists whether the medium is viscoelastic or not. The model is used to quantify the sensitivity of both the dispersion curves and the through-thickness mode shapes to the level of material viscoelasticity, and to physically explain the mode-coupling phenomenon. Finite element software is also used to confirm results obtained for the purely elastic structure. Finally, experiments are made using ultrasonic, air-coupled transducers for generating and detecting guided modes in the test-sandwich structure. The mode-coupling phenomenon is then confirmed, and the potential of the air-coupled system for developing single-sided, contactless, NDT applications of such structures is discussed.},

Together with the rise of additive manufacturing techniques, new possibilities are emerging from engineered porous micro-structures. In this work, we present a theoretical and numerical study of graded and anisotropic porous materials, for optimal broadband and angular absorption. Through a parametric study, the effective acoustic and geometric parameters of homogenized anisotropic unit cells constitute a database in which the optimal anisotropic and graded material will be searched for. We develop an optimization technique based on the simplex method that is relying on this database. The concepts of average absorption and diffuse field absorption coefficients are introduced and used to maximize angular acoustic absorption. Numerical results present the optimized absorption of the designed anisotropic and graded porous materials for different acoustic targets. The designed materials have anisotropic and graded effective properties, which enhance its sound absorption capabilities. While the anisotropy largely enhances the diffuse field absorbing when optimized at a single frequency, graded properties appear to be crucial for optimal broadband diffuse field absorption.},

  abstract = {Porous materials and metamaterials play a key role in sound absorbing and insulation solutions in acoustics. With the growing interest in additive manufacturing techniques, recent work has focused on the printing of porous and resonant structures for acoustic purposes. Usual metaporous surfaces/interfaces are generally built by periodically inserting resonant elements in an existing porous layer. This complex manufacturing process can be significantly simplified by using additive manufacturing techniques, which also eases the design and optimization of the metaporous surface. In this work, the acoustic properties of the metaporous surface are controlled by simple geometric parameters defining both the anisotropic porous layer and the shapes of the resonators. Hence, we focus on optimizing split-ring resonators embedded in a micro-treillis porous layer, which are built in a single part using additive manufacturing techniques. A finite-element method together with Bloch wave decomposition provides a numerical model used to predict the reflection and absorption coefficients under normal incidence. The geometric parameters of the anisotropic metaporous surface are then optimized by non-linear minimization techniques to maximize acoustic absorption. An optimal metaporous surface is 3D printed by fused-deposition modeling, and its acoustic properties are measured in an impedance tube. The measurements are in good agreement with the predicted optimal broadband absorption coefficient. This work demonstrates the benefits of additive manufacturing for designing metaporous acoustic surfaces.},

The method can be applied to any kind of material with layers, i.e., fluid, anisotropic and viscoelastic. The two external interfaces of the plate can be described as either vacuum/vacuum, fluid/vacuum, or fluid/fluid with a single fluid or fluid/fluid with two different fluids. The method is based on the discretization of the plate by using a finite differences scheme in its vertical direction. One global state vector is associated with inner discretized positions of each layer, and two local state vectors characterize the physical state at its bounds. Interfacial state vectors are introduced in certain situations at external and internal plate interfaces. With these state vectors and after pertinent algebraic manipulations, an eigenvalue system is built. Its solutions are searched by fixing the slowness, wavevector or frequency of guided waves. These three parameterizations correspond to three different physical models. For each case, discussions of dispersion curves and attenuation curves are given for guided modes in a plate loaded by fluids at one or two sides. This numerical tool is shown to provide convenience and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Greater demands for underwater sound absorption materials have been growing due to the concern about un\- derwater noise control in water. Among the range of existing materials, polymer-based materials are increasingly being utilized as underwater sound absorption materials. In this paper, different kinds of polymer-based mate\- rials for underwater sound absorption with regards to key factors associated with sound absorption properties, measurements, applications, and mechanisms are reviewed and summarized. Commonly used polymers for underwater sound comprise, in general, interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN), polymer foams, and gradient polymers. To further improve underwater sound absorption performance, different types of inclusions that are introduced into the polymer matrix to transform the polymers as underwater sound absorption materials via air voids, solid inclusions, nanofillers, and phononic crystals are discussed. Challenges for further development of better polymer-based acoustic materials to meet requirements of current and future underwater applications are also presented.},

  abstract = {Several numerical methods using non-polynomial interpolation have been proposed for wave propagation problems at high frequencies. The common feature of these methods is that in each element, the solution is approximated by a set of local solutions. They can provide very accurate solutions with a much smaller number of degrees of freedom compared to polynomial interpolation. There are however significant differences in the way the matching conditions enforcing the continuity of the solution between elements can be formulated. The similarities and discrepancies between several non-polynomial numerical methods are discussed in the context of the Helmholtz equation. The present comparison is concerned with the ultraweak variational formulation (UWVF), the least-squares method (LSM) and the discontinuous Galerkin method with numerical flux (DGM). An analysis in terms of Trefftz methods provides an interesting insight into the properties of these methods. Second, the UWVF and the LSM are reformulated in a similar fashion to that of the DGM. This offers a unified framework to understand the properties of several non-polynomial methods. Numerical results are also presented to put in perspective the relative accuracy of the methods. The numerical accuracies of the methods are compared with the interpolation errors of the wave bases. Copyright ᭧ 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Poro-elastic materials are commonly used for passive control of noise and vibration and are key to reducing noise emissions in many engineering applications, including the aerospace, automotive and energy industries. More efficient computational models are required to further optimise the use of such materials. In this paper, we present a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) with plane waves for poro-elastic materials using the Biot theory solved in the frequency domain. This approach offers significant gains in computational efficiency and is simple to implement (costly numerical quadratures of highly oscillatory integrals are not needed). It is shown that the Biot equations can be easily cast as a set of conservation equations suitable for the formulation of the wave-based DGM. A key contribution is a general formulation of boundary conditions as well as coupling conditions between different propagation media. This is particularly important when modelling porous materials as they are generally coupled with other media, such as the surround fluid or an elastic structure. The validation of the method is described first for a simple wave propagating through a porous material, and then for the scattering of an acoustic wave by a porous cylinder. The accuracy, conditioning and computational cost of the method are assessed, and comparison with the standard finite element method is included. It is found that the benefits of the wave-based DGM are fully realised for the Biot equations and that the numerical model is able to accurately capture both the oscillations and the rapid attenuation of the waves in the porous material.

  abstract = {The propagation of airborne plane waves in the presence of a meta poroelastic laminate, that is a poroelastic matrix coated with thin elastic layers at its facings and periodically-embedded with inclusions, is studied. Using the Finite Element Method (FEM) only would result in a drastic increase of the degrees of freedom due to the fine mesh required to account for the very thin coatings. Here, the approach relies on: the Bloch wave expansion of the fields in air; the modal Transfer Matrix Method to account for the coatings; and the coupling with the FEM model of the poroelastic matrix and the resonant inclusions. The model is developed for reflection and transmission problems and it can account for coatings with multiple layers. The procedure induces the addition of the Bloch coefficients in the FEM's linear system at a negligible additional computational cost. It is applied to the meta poroelastic laminates with poroelastic inclusions and rubber shell inclusions. The results are compared with those from the Multiple Scattering Theory and an excellent agreement between the methods is found. The approach offers a numerically-efficient way to account for coatings applied to meta poroelastic layers, and finds applications in industrial prototypes where coatings are widely used.},

Basis for design is the contribution of local resonance resonators to low frequency absorption of airborne sound. The accuracy of finite element calculation (FEA) is verified by the theoretical model established by transfer matrix (TM) method at radial coordinates. Relative to pure viscoelastic rubber and traditional cavity acoustic absorption structure, the proposed structure could show excellent broadband acoustic absorption performance below 10 kHz. The geometrical size, shape, and position of filler also affect the direction of shear wave propagation after the transformation, which is critical reason behind the broadband underwater acoustic absorption. Different geometries and material parameters also could adjust the acoustic absorption to a great extent.

  abstract = {In this research, we applied a polynomial hybrid approach for modeling longitudinal guided waves propagating in anisotropic composites multi-layered pipes. Theoretically, dispersion characteristic equations in cylindrical coordinate system were derived by introducing the state vector form of displacement and stress components. In virtue of the orthogonality completeness and recursion properties of Legendre polynomial series, the dispersion curves of longitudinal guided waves for arbitrary multi-layered anisotropic pipes can be obtained efficiently and accurately. As an alternative serial approach, it solves the wave propagation problem of complex anisotropic cylinders, and also avoids the tedious integral operations in the traditional Legendre polynomial method. The reliability of the numerical results of longitudinal guided waves propagating in arbitrary multi-layered anisotropic pipes was investigated based on the state matrix and Legendre polynomial hybrid method. At first, we calculated the multi-layered pipes composed of isotropic materials (steel and aluminum) with different diameter-thickness ratios and circumferential orders, and the results are consistent with the ones from the global matrix method. Then, the numerical analysis for a triple-layered adhesive pipe was implemented. Finally, the composite multi-layered pipes with at most 16 layers, which are the T300/914 in different orientations, were studied. Meanwhile, the effect of the layer number, fiber angle and circumferential order on the propagation characteristics of longitudinal guided waves were analyzed. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, we compared the dispersion curves of flat plate case with the results from the cylindrical case using the same physical properties by making the geometrical diameter to thickness ratio infinity. Furthermore, the displacements and stress distributions were also illustrated at given frequencies.},

  abstract = {Leaky waves are an important class of waves, particularly for guiding waves along structures embedded within another medium; a mismatch in wavespeeds often leads to leakage of energy from the waveguide, or interface, into the medium, which consequently attenuates the guided wave. The accurate and efficient identification of theoretical solutions for leaky waves is a key requirement for the choices of modes and frequencies required for non-destructive evaluation inspection techniques. We choose a typical situation to study: an elastic waveguide with a fluid on either side. Historically, leaky waves are identified via root-finding methods that have issues with conditioning, or numerical methods that struggle with the exponential growth of solutions at infinity. By building upon a spectral collocation method, we show how it can be adjusted to find exponentially growing solutions, i.e., leaky waves, leading to an accurate, fast, and efficient identification of their dispersion properties. The key concept required is a mapping, in the fluid region, that allows for exponential growth of the physical solution at infinity, whilst the mapped numerical setting decays. We illustrate this by studying leaky Lamb waves in an elastic waveguide immersed between two different fluids and verify this using the commercially available software DISPERSE.},

Due to the complex wavenumber solutions required to represent them, leaky waves pose significant challenges to existing numerical methods, while methods that spatially discretise the field to retrieve them suffer from the exponential growth of their amplitude far into the surrounding media. We present a spectral collocation method yielding an accurate and efficient identification of these modes, leaking into elastic half-spaces. We discretise the elastic domains and, depending on the exterior bulk wavespeeds, select appropriate mappings of the discretised domain to complex paths, in which the numerical solution decays and the physics of the problem are preserved. By iterating through all possible radiation cases, the full set of dispersion and attenuation curves are successfully retrieved and validated, where possible, against the commercially available software DISPERSE. As an independent validation, dispersion curves are obtained from finite element simulations of time-dependent waves using Fourier analysis.},

  abstract = {Having a material that is matched in acoustic impedance with the surrounding medium is a considerable asset for many underwater acoustic applications. In this work, impedance matching is achieved by dispersing small, deeply subwavelength sized particles in a soft matrix, and the appropriate concentration is determined with the help of Coherent Potential Approximation and Waterman \& Truell models. We show experimentally the validity of the models using mixtures of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and TiO2 particles. The optimized composite material has the same longitudinal acoustic impedance as water and therefore the acoustic reflection coefficient is essentially zero over a wide range of frequencies (0.5--6 MHz). PDMS-based materials can be cured in a mold to achieve desired sample shape, which makes them very easy to handle and to use. Various applications can be envisioned, such the use of impedance-matched PDMS in the design and fabrication of acoustically transparent cells for samples, perfectly matched layers for ultrasonic experiments, or superabsorbing metamaterials for water-borne acoustic waves.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a time domain method to determine viscoelastic properties of open-cell foams on a wide frequency range. This method is based on the adjustment of the stress--time relationship, obtained from relaxation tests on polymeric foams' samples under static compression, with the four fractional derivatives Zener model. The experimental relaxation function, well described by the Mittag--Leffler function, allows for straightforward prediction of the frequency-dependence of complex modulus of polyurethane foams. To show the feasibility of this approach, complex shear moduli of the same foams were measured in the frequency range between 0.1 and 16 Hz and at different temperatures between -20 {$^\circ$}C and 20 {$^\circ$}C. A curve was reconstructed on the reduced frequency range (0.1 Hz--1 MHz) using the time--temperature superposition principle. Very good agreement was obtained between experimental complex moduli values and the fractional Zener model predictions. The proposed time domain method may constitute an improved alternative to resonant and non-resonant techniques often used for dynamic characterization of polymers for the determination of viscoelastic moduli on a broad frequency range.},

The method is used to compute phase and group velocities of Rayleigh waves for two assumed three-layer models and one two-layer model of the earth's crust in the continents. The computed group velocity curves are compared with published values of the group velocities at various frequencies of Rayleigh waves over continental paths. The scatter of the observed values is larger than the difference between the three computed curves. It is believed that not all of this scatter is due to observational errors, but probably represents a real horizontal heterogeneity of the continental crusts.},

This study describes leaky Lamb wave calculation with the SAFE. We formulated a new solution using a feature that a single Lamb wave mode generates a harmonic plane wave in leaky media. Dispersion curves obtained with the SAFE agreed well with the previous theoretical studies, which represents that the SAFE calculation was conducted with sufficient accuracy.

Underwater absorption coefficients of different samples were measured by the pulse tube. Measurement results show that the new material possesses excellent underwater acoustic effects in a wide frequency range. Moreover, in order to investigate impacts of locally resonant units, some defects are introduced into the sample. The experimental result and the theoretical calculation both show that locally resonant units being connected to a network structure play an important role in achieving a wide band strong acoustic absorption.},

  abstract = {Multilayered plate and shell structures play an important role in many engineering settings where, for instance, coated pipes are commonplace such as in the petrochemical, aerospace, and power generation industries. There are numerous demands, and indeed requirements, on nondestructive evaluation (NDE) to detect defects or to measure material properties using guided waves; to choose the most suitable inspection approach, it is essential to know the properties of the guided wave solutions for any given multilayered system and this requires dispersion curves computed reliably, robustly, and accurately. Here, the circumstances are elucidated, and possible layer combinations, under which guided wave solutions, in multilayered systems composed of generally anisotropic layers in flat and cylindrical geometries, have specific properties of coupling and parity; the partial wave decomposition of the wave field is utilised to unravel the behaviour. A classification into five families is introduced and the authors claim that this is the fundamental way to approach generally anisotropic waveguides. This coupling and parity provides information to be used in the design of more efficient and robust dispersion curve tracing algorithms. A critical benefit is that the analysis enables the separation of solutions into categories for which dispersion curves do not cross; this allows the curves to be calculated simply and without ambiguity.},

Here we present a general stiffness matrix method for modelling waves in arbitrary multilayers. The method first formulates stiffness matrices for individual layers based on the governing wave equations for fluids and solids, and the Biot theory for porous materials. Then it utilises the boundary conditions considered at layer interfaces to assemble the layer matrices into a global system of equations, to obtain solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients at any incidence. Its advantage over existing methods is manifested by its unconditional computational stability, and its validity is proved by experimental validations on single solid sheets, porous layers, and porous-solid-porous battery electrodes. This establishes a powerful theoretical platform that allows us to develop advanced wave-based methods to quantitatively characterise properties of the layers, especially for layers of porous materials.},

  abstract = {Guided ultrasonic waves are used for the inspection of multilayered composite aerospace structures. Calculating the corresponding dispersion diagrams is challenging for thick-walled composites with more than 100 layers, such as in modern rocket booster pressure vessels. The Dispersion Calculator (DC) is an open source software for calculating such dispersion diagrams and mode shapes of guided waves. Attenuation caused by viscoelasticity and fluid-loading makes the dispersion curve tracing much more difficult than in the nonattenuated case because the modal solutions are sought in the complex wavenumber plane. The tracing problem is mastered by a reliable algorithm. Whereas leaky Lamb and Scholte waves in coupled and decoupled cases are modeled using the stiffness matrix method, shear horizontal (SH) waves are traced using the transfer matrix method without facing the numerical instability. Through implementation of mode family specific dispersion equations in both matrix techniques for nonattenuated and attenuated cases, symmetric, antisymmetric, and nonsymmetric leaky Lamb, Scholte, and SH waves can be traced separately with better efficiency and robustness. The capabilities of DC are demonstrated by calculating dispersion diagrams and mode shapes for a viscoelastic composite with 400 layers immersed in water. Results are compared against DISPERSE (Imperial College London, London, UK) for selected cases.},

We theoretically analyze different configurations of increasing complexity: a single layer of high-porous material, a layer of high-porous material with an air gap (air plenum), and an optimized multilayer structure. First, we show that to obtain normal incidence perfect sound absorption at the first so-called quarterwavelength resonance of a single rigidly-backed high-porous layer, the thickness of the material is strongly related to its flow resistivity. In particular, perfect sound absorption is observed when the quarter-wavelength resonance is around the characteristic Biot frequency of the high-porous media. We found that the optimal thickness of the layer is 4.64 smaller than the perfectly absorbed wavelength when using one-parameter empirical models for the effective parameters of the high-porous material. Then, we analyze the behavior of the structure for oblique angles of incidence, showing that perfect sound absorption is also produced for other incident angles and frequencies. Second, an air gap is introduced between the high-porous layer and the rigid backing. The gap allows to produce perfect sound absorption for structures thicker than the optimal one and for media with large intrinsic losses, i.e., for materials with high flow resistivity. Finally, optimized multilayer structures are proposed, which present broadband and perfect sound absorption. The existence of perfect absorption is related to the impedance matching, which is produced when the intrinsic losses of the system exactly compensate the leakage of the structure due to its resonance. Thus, to observe perfect sound absorption, in addition to and material properties, the total thickness of any multilayered porous structure is constrained to its quarter-wavelength resonance because of the lack of deep-subwavelength resonance in the system.},

In such case the propagation of waves can be accurately described by means of ray theory, and different refractive devices can be designed in the framework of wave propagation in inhomogeneous media.

Elastische Wellen die in der Rohrwand angeregt werden, interagieren mit dem angrenzenden Fluid und f{\"u}hren zur Ausbildung von quasi-gef{\"u}hrten Wellen. Diese stellen sowohl Leckwellen als auch Grenzschichtwellen dar. Die Abstrahlung der Leckwellen wird ausgenutzt, um das Innere des Rohres zu beschallen. Die quasi-gef{\"u}hrten Wellen werden im Detail analysiert, insbesondere bez{\"u}glich deren Abstrahlverhalten. Hierf{\"u}r werden hoch zuverl{\"a}ssige und effiziente Berechnungsmethoden entwickelt. Die Ultraschall-Laufzeit durch das Durchflussmessger{\"a}t wird systematisch mittels der zuvor genannten Wellen modelliert.

Im Vergleich zu konventionellen Ultraschall-Durchflussmessern kann f{\"u}r Ger{\"a}te basierend auf quasi-gef{\"u}hrten Wellen eine deutlich geringere Querempfindlichkeit zur Temperatur festgestellt werden, was auch experimentell best{\"a}tigt wird.

This paper investigates the acoustic properties of hemp-lime concrete, using binders developed from hydrated lime and pozzolans as well as hydraulic and cementicious binders. To assess the acoustic absorption of hemp-lime walls, as they are commonly finished in practical construction, wall sections are rendered and the resulting impact on absorption is evaluated. Hemp-concretes with lime-pozzolan binders display superior acoustic properties relative to more hydraulic binders. These are diminished when rendered, as the open surface porosity is affected, however hemp-lime construction offers the potential to meet standard and guideline targets for spaces requiring acoustic treatment.},

A nearly total absorption over a wide frequency band can be obtained for thin structures, even for frequencies below the quarter wavelength resonances i.e., in a sub-wavelength regime. The high absorption performances of this material are due to the interplay of usual visco-thermal losses, local resonances and trapped modes. The density of resonant and trapped modes in this dissipative porous layer, is a key parameter for broadband absorption. The best configurations and critical coupling conditions are found by genetic algorithm optimization. Several types of resonators are included gradually in the studied configurations (split-rings, Helmholtz resonators, back cavities) with increasing complexity. The optimization leads to a metaporous structure with a 2-cm sub-wavelength layer thickness, exhibiting a nearly total absorption between 1800 Hz and 7000 Hz. The influence of the incidence angle on the absorption properties is also shown.},

  abstract = {The theory of waves in an infinitely long cylindrical rod was discussed by Pochhammer in 1876 in a well-known paper. The somewhat simpler problem of two-dimensional waves in a solid bounded by parallel planes was considered by Lord Rayleigh and by the present writer{\ddag} in 1889. The main object in these various investigations was to verify, or to ascertain small corrections to, the ordinary theory of the vibrations of thin rods or plates, and the wave-length was accordingly assumed in the end to be great in comparison with the thickness. It occurred to me some time ago that a further examination of the two-dimensional problem was desirable for more than one reason. In the first place, the number of cases in which the various types of vibration of a solid, none of whose dimensions is regarded as small, have been studied is so restricted that any addition to it would have some degree of interest, if merely as a contribution to elastic theory. Again, modern seismology has suggested various questions relating to waves and vibrations in an elastic stratum imagined as resting on matter of a different elasticity and density. These questions naturally present great mathematical difficulties, and it seemed unpromising to attempt any further discussion of them unless the comparatively simple problem which forms the subject of this paper should be found to admit of a practical solution. In itself it has, of course, no bearing on the questions referred to.},

  abstract = {A sound wave travelling in water is scattered by a periodic assembly of air bubbles. The local structure matters even in the low frequency regime. If the bubbles are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, a total band gap opens near the Minnaert resonance frequency. If they are arranged in the diamond structure, which one obtains by simply adding a second bubble to the unit cell, one finds an additional branch with a negative slope (optical branch). For a single specific frequency, the medium behaves as if its refractive index (relative to water) is exactly \$n=-1\$. We show that a slab of this material can be used to design a three three-dimensional flat lens. We also report super-resolution focusing in the near field of the slab and illustrate its potential for imaging in three dimensions.},

  abstract = {The current study is a bibliographic observation on prevailing tendencies in the development of acoustic absorption by natural fiber composites. Despite having less detrimental environmental effects and thorough availability, natural fibers are still unsuitable for wide implementation in industrial purposes. Some shortcomings such as the presence of moisture contents, thicker diameter, and lower antifungus quality hold up the progress of natural fiber composites in staying competitive with synthetic composites. The review indicates the importance of the pretreatment of fresh natural fiber to overcome these shortcomings. However, the pretreatment of natural fiber causes the removal of moisture contents which results in the decrease of its acoustic absorption performance. Incorporation of granular materials in treated fiber composite is expected to play a significant role as a replacement for moisture contents. This review aims to investigate the acoustic absorption behavior of natural fiber composites due to the incorporation of granular materials. It is intended that this review will provide an overview of the analytical approaches for the modeling of acoustic wave propagation through the natural fiber composites. The possible influential factors of fibers and grains were described in this study for the enhancement of low frequency acoustic absorption of the composites.},

  abstract = {A semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method is presented for analyzing the wave propagation in viscoelastic axisymmetric waveguides. The approach extends a recent study presented by the authors, in which the general SAFE method was extended to account for material damping. The formulation presented in this paper uses the cylindrical coordinates to reduce the finite element discretization over the waveguide cross-section to a mono-dimensional mesh. The algorithm is validated by comparing the dispersion results with viscoelastic cases for which a Superposition of Partial Bulk Waves solution is known. The formulation accurately predicts dispersion properties and does not show any missing root. Applications to viscoelastic axisymmetric waveguides with varying mechanical and geometrical properties are presented. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical method for analyzing elastic wave scattering by multi-layered periodic structures in two dimensions. The proposed method is based on the boundary element method (BEM) and scattering matrix representing a relationship between incoming and outgoing waves in the vicinity of a periodic structure. First, we define the scattering matrix using a plane-wave expansion of the solution of the elastic problem. Then, we show the integral formulae that convert the solution of a system of boundary integral equations into elements of the scattering matrix. The proposed scattering matrix method with the BEM enables us to reduce the scattering problem in a multi-layered structure to a purely algebraic one in terms of the scattering matrix of each layer, resulting into less requirement in computational resources than in the methods which are based on the meshing of an entire boundary and solution of the corresponding boundary integral equations. Such a procedure called layerdoubling method is implemented in a numerically stable manner based on the eigendecomposition of a relevant matrix. Moreover, some scattering properties and phononic band structures of semi-infinite phononic crystals are yielded through an asymptotic analysis on the scattering matrix. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method can solve accurately scattering problems and also can calculate some related eigenmodes including the Bloch modes and guided waves within stacked structures.},

  abstract = {Acoustic fields scattered by poroelastic materials contain key information about the materials' pore structure and elastic properties. Therefore, such materials are often characterised with inverse methods that use acoustic measurements. However, it has been shown that results from many existing inverse characterisation methods agree poorly. One reason is that inverse methods are typically sensitive to even small uncertainties in a measurement setup, but these uncertainties are difficult to model and hence often neglected. In this paper, we study characterising poroelastic materials in the Bayesian framework, where measurement uncertainties can be taken into account, and which allows us to quantify uncertainty in the results. Using the finite element method, we simulate measurements where ultrasonic waves are incident on a water-saturated poroelastic material in normal and oblique angles. We consider uncertainties in the incidence angle and level of measurement noise, and then explore the solution of the Bayesian inverse problem, the posterior density, with an adaptive parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results show that both the elastic and pore structure parameters can be feasibly estimated from ultrasonic measurements.},

The acoustical characterisation of poroelastic materials based on various measurements is typically carried out by minimizing a cost functional of model residuals, such as the least squares functional. With a limited number of unknown parameters, least squares type approaches can provide both reliable parameter and error estimates. With an increasing number of parameters, both the least squares parameter estimates, and in particular, the error estimates often become unreliable. In this paper, we consider the estimation of the material parameters of an inhomogeneous poroelastic (Biot) plate in the Bayesian framework for inverse problems. We carry out reflection and transmission measurements and estimate 11 poroelastic parameters as well as 4 measurement setup-related nuisance parameters. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the computational inference to assess the actual uncertainty of the estimated parameters. The results suggest that the proposed approach for poroelastic material characterisation can reveal the heterogeneities in the object and yield reliable parameter and uncertainty estimates.},

Currently, the need for tools predicting the acoustical and structural behaviors of such structures is considerably increasing. In this paper, such a tool is presented. It is applied to the sound transmission loss through multilayer structures made from a combination of elastic, air, and poroelastic materials. The presented approach is based on a three-dimensional finite element model. It uses classical elastic and fluid elements to model the elastic and fluid media. For the poroelastic material, it uses a two-field displacement formulation derived from the Biot theory. Furthermore, it couples with a boundary element approach to account, when important, for fluid--structure coupling and to calculate the transmission loss through the multilayer structure. Numerical predictions of the transmission loss through a poroelastic material sandwiched between two finite elastic plates are presented for various configurations. It is shown that the unbonded/bonded configuration gives better transmission loss. Also, comparisons with laterally infinite double panels and with an equivalent fluid approach for the porous material are presented. It is shown that these two simplified models lead to erroneous predictions at low frequencies and for certain design configurations, respectively.},

These squares can then be refined to any prespecified rational width. Furthermore, the algorithms can associate with each square the multiplicity of the unique root of G contained in that square. Exact arithmetic is used so that all computational errors are eliminated. The system is self-sufficient in the sense that no starting approximations are needed, and no user interaction during computation is required. The methods used ensure termination of the algorithms with the desired squares regardless of such aspects as multiple roots, roots which are distinct but very close together, or polynomials with high condition numbers. Theoretical computing times are analyzed and compared to empirical results.},

Biot's theory was used for describing the dynamic behavior of aniso\- tropic poroelastic material. Assuming the structures is homogeneous along its axial direction, the Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) was successfully employed in procedures using isogeometric Galerkin and colloca\- tion methods. The numeral studies showed that the SAIGA-G method using high continuity NURBS basis allowed to significantly improve the accuracy as well as the convergence rate of the wave dispersion solutions in compared with the conventional SAFE method, which used Lagrange basis functions. Otherwise, the SAIGA-C method was shown to have similar performance in terms of accuracy to the SAFE method.},

  abstract = {Generally, the better sound absorption characteristics can be achieved in the low frequency band by embedding resonance units into the conventional anechoic coating. However, in this way, the frequency range of effective sound absorption is relatively narrow, which limits the application of anechoic coating in engineering. In this paper, in order to optimize this sound absorption characteristics, a new type of underwater sound absorption metamaterials with multi-resonator are proposed based on the coupled resonance mechanism. The underwater sound absorption characteristics of the proposed metamaterials with steel plate backing are investigated by finite element method (FEM). The effect of coupled resonance between the resonators on the sound absorption characteristics of metamaterials is investigated. In addition, the effect of the geometric structure of steel plate backing on the sound absorption characteristics is studied as well. Numerical results show that the proposed metamaterials have many advantages over the conventional anechoic coating in underwater sound absorption due to the coupled resonance effect. Moreover, the steel plate backing has a significant effect on the sound absorption characteristics of the proposed metamaterials, especially, in the low frequency range.},

  abstract = {The modes of vibration of an elastic plate are usually divided into propagating and nonpropagating kinds. While nonpropagating modes characterize local vibration nearby a perturbation source, which can be either an external force or a geometrical discontinuity, propagating modes carry energy along the waveguide and account for the vibration far away from the perturbation source. In this paper, by considering that the modes of an absorbing plate are always propagating, it is shown that each elastic mode consists of propagating and nonpropagating branches, which turn into a single propagating mode as soon as internal absorption is considered. Moreover, it is shown how introducing a little material damping leads to a rigorous differentiation of elastic modes when they are connected. A similar result can be obtained by loading the plate with a light fluid [Rokhlin et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am.\hphantom{,}85, 1074--1080 (1989)].},

  abstract = {In this article, a general method is proposed to model layered acoustical systems with two-by-two transfer matrices, and further, to solve for their acoustic absorption, reflection, and transmission coefficients. Since the proposed method uses the matrix representation of various layers and interfaces, as in the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), the equation system can be established efficiently. However, the traditional TMM can become unstable when there is a large disparity between the magnitudes of the waves traveling in opposite directions within the layers (i.e., at higher frequencies, for a thick layer, or for extreme parameter values). In such cases, the contribution of the most attenuated wave can be masked by numerical errors and can induce instability when solving the system. Therefore, in the proposed method, the accuracy of the wave attenuation terms is ensured by decomposing each layer's transfer matrix and reformulating the equation system. This method can be used to couple different layer types in a general way and is easy to assemble and implement with numerical code. The predicted acoustic properties of layered systems calculated using the proposed method have been validated by comparison with those predicted by previously-existing methods.},

  abstract = {Piezoelectric shunt damping technology has been applied in the field of underwater sound absorption in recent years. In order to achieve broadband echo reduction, semiactive control of sound absorption of multi-layered piezoelectric coating by shunt damping is significant. In this paper, a practical method is proposed to control the underwater sound absorption coefficients of piezoelectric coating layers by combining design of the shunt impedance that allows certain sound absorption coefficients at setting frequencies. A one-dimensional electro-acoustic model of the piezoelectric coating and the backing is established based on the Mason equivalent circuit theory. First, the shunt impedance of the coating is derived under the constraint of sound absorption coefficient at one frequency. Then, taking the 1--3 piezoelectric composite coating as an example, the sound absorption properties of the coating shunted to the designed shunt impedance are investigated. Next, on the basis of that, an iterative method for two constrained frequencies and an optimizing algorithm for multiple constrained frequencies are provided for combining design of the shunt impedances. At last, an experimental sample with four piezoelectric material layers is manufactured, of which the sound absorption coefficients are measured in an impedance tube. The experimental results show good agreement with the finite element simulation results. It is proved that a serial R--L circuit can control the peak frequency, maximum and bandwidth of the sound absorption coefficient and the combining R--L circuits shunted to multiple layers can control the sound absorption coefficients at multiple frequencies.},

Various fibrous materials including inorganic and metallic fibers, synthetic fibers, natural fibers, and nanofibrous membranes for noise reduction are reviewed. Inorganic and metallic fibers have the advantages of corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance and long service life. The tailored cross-sections of synthetic fibers such as circle, hollow and triangle are beneficial to improve acoustic absorption properties. Natural fibrous materials are biodegradable, renewable and eco-friendly. Nanofibrous materials are lightweight and have good potential in low frequency noise reduction.

  abstract = {Elastic guided waves are of interest for inspecting structures due to their ability to propagate over long distances. In numerous applications, the guiding structure is surrounded by a solid matrix that can be considered as unbounded in the transverse directions. The physics of waves in such an open waveguide significantly differs from a closed waveguide, i.e. for a bounded cross-section. Except for trapped modes, part of the energy is radiated in the surrounding medium, yielding attenuated modes along the axis called leaky modes. These leaky modes have often been considered in non destructive testing applications, which require waves of low attenuation in order to maximize the inspection distance. The main difficulty with numerical modeling of open waveguides lies in the unbounded nature of the geometry in the transverse direction. This difficulty is particularly severe due to the unusual behavior of leaky modes: while attenuating along the axis, such modes exponentially grow along the transverse direction. A simple numerical procedure consists in using absorbing layers of artificially growing viscoelasticity, but large layers may be required. The goal of this paper is to explore another approach for the computation of trapped and leaky modes in open waveguides. The approach combines the so-called semi-analytical finite element method and a perfectly matched layer technique. Such an approach has already been successfully applied in scalar acoustics and electromagnetism. It is extended here to open elastic waveguides, which raises specific difficulties. In this paper, two-dimensional stratified waveguides are considered. As it reveals a rich structure, the numerical eigenvalue spectrum is analyzed in a first step. This allows to clarify the spectral objects calculated with the method, including radiation modes, and their dependency on the perfectly matched layer parameters. In a second step, numerical dispersion curves of trapped and leaky modes are compared to analytical results.},

Most previous methods for separating up/down propagating wavefields are expensive because of the requirement to save time steps to perform Fourier transforms over time. An alternate approach for separation of up-and down-going waves, based on extrapolation of complex data traces is extended from acoustic to elastic, and combined with P- and S-wave decomposition by decoupled propagation. This preserves all the information in the original data and eliminates the need for a Fourier transform over time, thereby significantly reducing the storage cost and improving computational efficiency. Wavefield decomposition is applied to synthetic elastic VSP data and propagating wavefield snapshots. Poynting vectors obtained from the particle velocity and stress fields after P/S and up/down decompositions are much more accurate than those without because interference between the corresponding wavefronts is significantly reduced. Elastic reverse time migration with the P/S and up/down decompositions indicated significant improvement compared with those without decompositions, when applied to elastic data from a portion of the Marmousi2 model.},

In this paper, a pseudo-spectral collocation method, based on Fourier basis functions, is proposed for the numerical solutions of two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) inhomogeneous elliptic boundary value problems. We describe how one can improve the numerical accuracy by making some extra ``reconstruction techniques'' before applying the traditional Fourier series approximation. After the particular solutions have been obtained, the resulting homogeneous equation can then be calculated using various boundary-type methods, such as the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). Using Fourier basis functions, one does not need to use large matrices, making accrual computations relatively fast. Three benchmark numerical examples involving Poisson, Helmholtz, and modified-Helmholtz equations are presented to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Open-celled silicon carbide (SiC) foam has been proven of a promising underwater acoustic absorption material. However, further improvement of its sound absorption capacity especially at low frequency is restricted by the acoustic impedance mismatch between the foam material and the water surrounding it. How to tailor the existing SiC foam in order to achieve an optimized impedance match is a key issue. In this work, the underwater acoustic absorption performance of open-celled SiC foam is studied by both analytical and experimental methods. First, based on Zwikker--Kosten's theory, the modified Johnson--Allard (J--A) model is proposed to analytically predict the absorption performance of liquid-saturated SiC foam. Then three approaches including (i) backing the test samples by a 30-mm-thick air cavity, (ii) enclosing a certain amount of water and (iii) filling the samples with silicon oil are proposed to improve the underwater sound absorption performance of SiC foam. The underwater acoustic absorbency of the silicon oil filled SiC foam is significantly improved, especially in the low frequency band. A sound absorption coefficient near unity is achieved by this manner over a significant portion of the investigated frequency range, eg. 750--4000 Hz. The foam partially filled with water also shows enhanced sound absorbency at low frequency, but the foams backed by air gap and saturated fully by water display degraded sound absorption capacity.},

  abstract = {The recent advent of acoustic metamaterials has initiated a strong revival of interest on the subject of sound absorption. The present review is based on the physics perspective as the coherent basis of this diverse field. For conventional absorbers, viscous dissipation and heat conduction at the fluidsolid interface, when expressed through micro-geometric parameters, yield an effective medium description of porous media and micro-perforated panels as effectual sound absorbers. Local resonances and their geometric and symmetry constraints serve as the framework for surveying a variety of acoustic metamaterial absorbers that can realize previously unattainable absorption spectra with subwavelength-scale structures. These structures include decorated membrane resonators, degenerate resonators, hybrid resonators, and coiled Fabry-Pe{\textasciiacute}rot and Helmholtz resonators. As the acoustic response of any structure or material must obey the causality principle, the implied constraint---which relates the absorption spectrum of a sample to its required minimum thickness---is presented as a means to delineate what is ultimately possible for sound-absorbing structures. The review concludes by describing a recently reported strategy for realizing structures that can exhibit customdesigned absorption spectra, as well as its implementation in the form of a broadband absorber with a thickness that is close to the minimum value as dictated by causality.},

  abstract = {The propagation of evanescent waves in hybrid poroelastic metamaterials is investigated by considering interface effects. Hybrid metamaterials consist of a single-phased (acoustic or elastic) medium and a poroelastic medium. To establish the finite element model of elastic/poroelastic and fluid/poroelastic interfaces, weak integral forms of wave equations for elastic, fluid, and poroelastic media and boundary conditions at the interfaces between different media are first given. Next, the expressions for displacement and pressure in the frame of Bloch's theorem are substituted into the dynamical equations to obtain general forms suitable for periodic metamaterials, from which the complex band structure and the frequency response of hybrid metamaterials are calculated. The influence of geometrical and material parameters, as well as the viscosity of the pore fluid on the propagation of elastic waves are discussed. The results and discussions show that flat bands and narrow locally resonant band gaps appear for elastic/poroelastic metamaterials. A quasi-resonance Bragg band gap is formed in the case of an elastic inclusion in a poroelastic matrix. Furthermore, a transition from an avoided crossing to a wave-number band gap is obtained by adjusting the geometrical and material parameters of the elastic inclusion. For the case of fluid inclusion in a poroelastic matrix with the open-pore interface, a cut-off frequency for the fast longitudinal wave is observed. However, only an avoided crossing is produced for the sealed-pore interface. For both cases, the phase velocity of the shear vertical (SV) wave decreases faster than that of the slow longitudinal wave as the radius of the inclusion increases. When the viscosity of the pore fluid is considered for elastic inclusion in a poroelastic matrix, the transmission dip at the `quasi-resonance Bragg' band gap disappears. However, the transmission dip in the locally resonant band gap of the SV wave becomes slightly shallower and smoother than in the inviscid case. This study is relevant to practical applications of hybrid single-phased and poroelastic metamaterials, e.g., for coastal engineering and civil engineering.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Effective absorption of low-frequency waterborne sound with subwavelength absorbers has always been a challenging work. In this paper, we derive two theoretical requirements for broadband perfect absorption of low-frequency waterborne sound by ultrathin acoustic metasurface under a finite-thickness steel plate followed by semi-infinite air. Based on the theoretical requirements, an acoustic metasurface, a rubber layer embedded periodically with cavities, is inversely designed to achieve perfect absorption at 500\,Hz. The metasurface is as thin as 1\% of the working wavelength and maintains a substantially high absorptance over a relatively broad bandwidth. The perfect absorption peak is attributed to the overall resonance mode of the metasurface/steel plate system. Besides, high absorption can still be achieved even if the loss factor of the given rubber material cannot meet the ideal requirement. Finally, a strategy to utilize the inherent frequency-dependent characteristics of dynamic parameters of rubber material is suggested to achieve an ultra-broadband perfect absorption. When the frequency-dependent characteristics of the given rubber matrix cannot meet the theoretical requirements, a broadband super-absorption can still be realized by properly designing the frequency position of perfect absorption of the cavity-based metasurface.},

  abstract = {We present a design of a low-frequency perfect acoustic absorption metaporous composite with frequency tunability and the insensitivity to the incident angle based on a critical coupling mechanism. The metaporous composite is constructed by embedding an Archimedean spiral structure in traditional porous materials. We verified the tunable balance of the dissipation and leakage of the metaporous composite by adjusting the slit orientation of the embedded spiral and the width and depth of the porous materials. Our simulations show that the composite's thickness is 1/20th of the corresponding wavelength at the perfect absorption (PA). Experiment and complex frequency plane analysis confirm the perfect acoustic absorption. The simulations show that the acoustic absorption of the system is highly efficient (0.95), up to a large oblique incidence, e.g., 60. We also achieve the dual-band PA by embedding two spirals or using the higher order mode of a single spiral. The proposed composite absorber provides promising potential for low-frequency noise reduction applications.},

    abstract = {Guided waves are used for the non-destructive evaluation in automotive and aerospace industries. There is a trend leaning away from isotropic materials to the manufacturing based on composites. However, the elastic wave dynamics in such materials is considerably more complicated. Much effort has been committed to the calculation of guided waves' dispersion curves in composites. Lots of methods and tools are available, but it becomes difficult when there are more than one hundred layers. In this paper the calculation of dispersion diagrams and mode shapes using the stiffness matrix method is demonstrated. Boundary conditions are implemented into the stiffness matrix method that allow for the separate tracing of the various mode families. Shear horizontal modes are modeled with the transfer matrix method without facing any numerical instability. It is elucidated just how the occurrence of the mode families depends on the system's symmetry and wave propagation direction. As a result, the robustness and reliability of guided wave modeling by using the stiffness method is improved, and more information about the modes is yielded. This is demonstrated on exemplary layups of the fiber reinforced polymer T800/913, with up to 400 layers. Referencing is made against results from DISPERSE® (Imperial College London, London, UK) for selected cases.},
